After a week filled with diligent research and writing, he understands the importance of taking a moment to unwind before diving back into academic responsibilities. He plans to start his day at around 8:00 AM, allowing for a leisurely breakfast that combines nourishment and enjoyment.

He will prepare a simple meal before spending the latter part of the evening engaged in leisure reading or watching a show, reinforcing his commitment to maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
