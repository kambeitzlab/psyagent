Currently: Status: On Wednesday, February 22, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 AM, reaffirming her commitment to maintain a semblance of routine in the face of her grief. As she moves through her morning routine, the actions still feel tinged with sorrow, yet she seeks solace in the familiar rhythm of her day. By 7:00 AM, she prepares a simple breakfast alongside her usual cup of coffee, drawing comfort from the warmth of the ritual.

Arriving at Hobbs Cafe by 8:00 AM after leaving her home at 7:30 AM, Isabella is determined to embrace her responsibilities despite an undercurrent of sadness. She serves customers from 8:00 AM until 12:00 PM, trying to muster the usual energy, but finds it challenging as she navigates through her emotions. The joy she typically finds in the hustle of the cafe feels dulled, yet she remains committed to providing excellent service.

After taking a quick lunch break at 12:30 PM, Isabella returns to the cafe to continue her shift from 1:00 PM until 4:00 PM. During this time, recollections of her mother's guidance and support emerge, making both the memories of the past and the realities of the present all the more poignant.

From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, Isabella focuses on finalizing event details from the recent Valentine's Day party. Acknowledging how overwhelming the tasks can be, she considers delegating some responsibilities to her supportive friend Maria Lopez, reminding herself that asking for help is okay. After transitioning back into a customer service role from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, Isabella resolves to take necessary breaks, honoring her emotional needs throughout her work.

Once the cafe closes at 8:00 PM, she returns home around 8:30 PM, planning to prepare dinner—though she opts for something simple given her emotional state. The evening is reserved for winding down, where she intends to reflect on her day, whether by reading or watching her favorite show until 10:30 PM.

Isabella understands the importance of self-care amidst her busy schedule and endeavors to check in with her emotions regularly. While she continues to navigate a whirlwind of feelings, she finds gratitude in the support from friends who help her honor her mother’s memory. Today is another step in her healing journey, and she embraces the connection with those around her, reminding herself that she is not alone in this process.
