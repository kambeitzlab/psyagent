Currently: Status: Isabella Rodriguez begins her Friday, February 24, with a mix of determination and lingering sorrow. Rising at 6:00 AM, she embraces her structured morning routine, finding comfort in the familiar tasks that start her day. At 7:00 AM, she prepares breakfast and savors a warm cup of coffee, using this quiet moment to gather her thoughts and summon strength for the day ahead.

With a focus on maintaining her routine, Isabella heads to Hobbs Café at 7:30 AM, ready to open the café by 8:00 AM. The lively atmosphere of the café provides a temporary distraction from her grief, and she greets customers with a warm smile, embodying a sense of purpose as she serves them until noon. 

After a busy morning, she takes a brief lunch break at 12:30 PM, before returning to her work from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. As she immerses herself in the café's operations, she feels the connection to her mother and finds solace in honoring her memory through her choices and actions.

In the evening, she allows herself the luxury of unwinding with a book or watching TV, taking time to process her emotions until it’s time to prepare for bed at 10:30 PM.

Throughout the day, Isabella remains acutely aware of the emotional complexities she faces. While she navigates the routine with diligence, the weight of her mother's passing is never far from her heart. However, she takes pride in her ability to push through, recognizing the importance of self-care and support from friends, such as Maria Lopez.
