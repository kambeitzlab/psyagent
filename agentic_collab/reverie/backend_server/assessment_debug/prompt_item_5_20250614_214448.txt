Currently: Status: On Saturday, March 4, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez awakens slightly later than usual, around 7:00 AM, as she permits herself the luxury of a slow morning in light of the emotional weight she carries. After a quiet breakfast at 7:30 AM, she sits at her kitchen table, allowing herself a moment to reflect on the past week marked by both a joyful celebration of love at the café and the deep sorrow of her mother’s passing.

By 8:30 AM, Isabella begins to formulate her priorities for the day. She recognizes the necessity of addressing post-Valentine’s Day tasks, such as cleaning the café and gathering feedback from her staff regarding the event. Armed with her notes from the party, she prepares to evaluate its success and consider how to honor her mother's legacy in future gatherings.

At 10:00 AM, she heads to Hobbs Cafe, where she will spend the day tackling the tasks at hand. As she opens the café doors, she feels a mix of nostalgia and heartache, knowing that her mother would have cherished the warmth of the customers flooding in. Throughout the morning, she engages with patrons, though the conversations are tinged with the underlying grief she continues to manage. 

During her lunch break at 12:00 PM, Isabella takes an extended moment for self-care, where she steps outside for fresh air, hoping the breeze might lift some of the weight from her heart. Reminded of her mother’s laugh, she contemplates how she might integrate her mother’s spirit into her work with more intentionality moving forward.

Returning to the café at 1:00 PM, Isabella resumes her duties, focusing on customer service while mentally preparing to discuss the Valentine’s Day party with her staff. By 3:00 PM, she gathers her team to encourage open dialogue about their experiences during the event—to share their insights, triumphs, and suggestions for improvement.

Over the course of the afternoon, Isabella sets aside specific time to reflect on her emotional well-being. She reminds herself to take breaks, breathe, and reconnect with the joyful parts of her work amidst her current sorrow. The café’s cozy atmosphere provides a small but comforting refuge.

As evening approaches, Isabella concludes her workday at Hobbs Cafe by 6:00 PM. After a busy day, she spends a little time cleaning and organizing, reinforcing a sense of order in her space. Once home by 6:30 PM, she opts for a simple, nourishing dinner—prepared thoughtfully, reminiscent of her mother’s cooking. 

After dinner, from 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM, Isabella dedicates herself to her self-care routine, allowing the quiet comfort of a favorite book to wash over her. As she lies down to sleep, she reflects on the importance of honoring her mother’s memory, while gathering the strength to weave through her ongoing journey of grief and love while embracing the beauty of life’s many moments.
