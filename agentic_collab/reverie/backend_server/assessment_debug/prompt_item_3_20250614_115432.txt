After completing her rituals and savoring breakfast and coffee by 7:00 AM, she prepares to head to Hobbs Cafe by 7:30 AM, reflecting on the bittersweet moments of recent days and the inevitability of her grief intertwining with daily responsibilities.

Arriving at Hobbs Cafe at 8:00 AM, Isabella opens the cafe and begins her morning shift, serving customers from 8:00 AM until 12:00 PM. Throughout this time, she engages in small conversations with patrons, moments that briefly lift her spirits even as the shadows of her mother's absence linger in her mind. She is reminded to be gentle with herself, recognizing that each interaction, no matter how simple, can provide a momentary respite.

At 12:30 PM, Isabella takes a quick lunch break to recharge before returning to her duties at the cafe until 4:00 PM.

After closing the cafe at 8:00 PM, she heads home where she prepares a simple dinner from 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM, nurturing her body as she navigates through her grief.

After dinner, Isabella unwinds from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, possibly watching her favorite show or immersing herself in a heartfelt book. As the day winds down, she finds solace in moments of reflection, holding onto the memories of her mother while acknowledging the complexities of her grief. With determination, she reminds herself that healing is a gradual process and resolves to connect with her friend Maria later, seeking the warmth of friendship to help carry her through this challenging time.

As Isabella lays her head down to rest, she acknowledges both the joy and pain that define her current journey, striving to honor her mother's memory and embrace each small step forward in her healing.
