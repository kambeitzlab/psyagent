Currently: Status: Maria Lopez is entering Tuesday, February 21, with a heightened awareness of her recent experiences and a commitment to maintain her academic focus despite the stress from her research grant rejection. She has structured her day similarly to the previous day, starting with her routine: waking up at 9:00 AM and enjoying a nutritious breakfast at 9:30 AM to fuel her morning.

Her dedicated study sessions at Hobbs Cafe are set to continue, with her focusing on her physics studies from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM.

Following her morning study block, she will take a lunch break at 12:00 PM and then return to studying physics from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, allowing her to maximize her focus and productivity.

Maria has also acknowledged the importance of managing her stress and has planned short breaks during her study sessions to help reset her mind and maintain her mental well-being. After her study sessions, she will shift gears to her Twitch streaming commitments, where she will be live from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Streaming provides her with an outlet to unwind and connect with her audience, which she finds rewarding.

As evening approaches, Maria has scheduled dinner at home around 6:00 PM, after which she plans to relax and enjoy some gaming time from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. This downtime is crucial for recharging her energy and finding joy outside her studies. She will then return to streaming on Twitch from 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM, sharing her passion for gaming with her viewers.

Finally, Maria intends to wind down and prepare for bed between 12:00 AM and 2:00 AM. In addition to her structured routine, she has recognized the need to dedicate some time for reading or conducting research for her ongoing project on gentrification, ensuring that she stays on track with her academic goals.
