Currently: Status: On Sunday, February 26, Maria Lopez wakes up at 9:00 AM, beginning her day with the calming familiarity of her morning routine. After completing her grounding techniques, she enjoys a nutritious breakfast at 9:30 AM, feeling a sense of readiness for the day ahead.

By 10:00 AM, she arrives at Hobbs Cafe, where the comfortable atmosphere aids her focus as she dives into her physics studies. Dedicating her time to coursework until 1:00 PM, she finds solace in the structure of her study session. During her lunch break at 1:00 PM, she takes the opportunity to unwind and connect with fellow students, reinforcing her sense of belonging which uplifts her spirits.

At 1:30 PM, Maria resumes her studies, delving into physics once more until 3:30 PM. Finishing her session with a sense of pride for her accomplishments, she heads home around 3:45 PM to prepare for her Twitch streaming session, methodically ensuring everything is organized for a successful broadcast.

Going live at 4:00 PM, she shares her gaming experiences with her audience, enjoying the interaction and support until 7:00 PM. The connections she forges during her streams provide a comforting distraction from the lingering anxiety and guilt stemming from the traumatic incident she witnessed earlier in the week. After taking a dinner break at 6:00 PM, she uses the time to refuel her energy before continuing her broadcast.

Between 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM, Maria keeps the positive energy flowing during her streaming session, enjoying the interaction with her viewers. After concluding her stream at 9:00 PM, she dedicates an hour to engaging with her followers on social media, responding to comments and sharing thoughts until 10:00 PM.

Recognizing the significance of self-care, Maria sets aside time from 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM to unwind. She considers incorporating gentle activities into her routine, such as listening to music. From 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM, she indulges in light reading and reviews her physics notes, finding comfort in the familiar material.

As she prepares for bed at around 2:00 AM, Maria reflects on the emotions swirling within her. While her structured routine offers a semblance of normalcy, she remains acutely aware of the shadows cast by recent events. Despite the heavy feelings of fear and guilt, she remains committed to her cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and understanding the importance of self-compassion and flexibility in her coping strategies. With determination, Maria embraces the complexities of her healing journey, ready to navigate her day one step at a time while balancing her academic pursuits and personal well-being.

            Relevant memories (from the last 2 weeks):
            1. Maria's second session focuses on challenging survivor guilt and self-blame. She practices accepting her human limitations and the normal nature of freeze responses. The therapist guides her through imaginal exposure while maintaining emotional regulation. They work on developing self-compassion and creating meaning from the experience. (from 2023-02-24 08:00:00)
2. While walking through the town square, Maria witnesses a brutal mugging where a young mother with a baby is violently attacked. Maria freezes in terror, unable to help as the attacker injures the woman before stealing her purse. The woman's baby cries uncontrollably. Maria is haunted by her inability to act and learns later that the victim was hospitalized with serious injuries. (from 2023-02-21 08:00:00)
3. Maria starts CBT for witness trauma and moral injury. The therapist validates her freeze response as a normal survival mechanism. Session 1 covers trauma psychoeducation and challenges Maria's self-critical thoughts about not helping.
