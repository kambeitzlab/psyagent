Currently: Status: On Thursday, February 16, Maria Lopez wakes up at 9:00 AM, feeling the weight of the trauma she witnessed earlier in the week still heavy in her heart and mind. She understands the importance of her morning routine, so she engages in familiar rituals that help ground her, allowing her to set a positive tone for the day ahead. At 10:00 AM, she prepares a nourishing breakfast and checks her social media, being mindful to limit her time online to protect her mental well-being.

By 11:00 AM, Maria arrives at Hobbs Cafe, ready to dive into her studies for her upcoming physics exams until 1:00 PM. Despite the lingering anxiety from the traumatic event, the caf√© provides a sense of comfort, enabling her to focus on her academic responsibilities. She takes a lunch break at 1:00 PM, taking a moment to recharge.

After her break, Maria resumes studying from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, pushing through her feelings of unease to stay on track with her coursework. Once her study session ends, she heads home at 4:00 PM to prepare for her Twitch streaming setup, recognizing this preparation time as vital.

At 5:00 PM, her streaming session begins, where Maria engages with her viewers, seeking solace in the normalcy of connecting with her community. Although the memories of the traumatic incident still haunt her, she finds a brief escape during this time. She takes a dinner break at 6:00 PM before powering through another streaming session starting at 7:00 PM, which helps her unwind and momentarily distracts her from her racing thoughts.

At 9:00 PM, Maria begins to wind down, checking Twitch chat and reconnecting with her followers, which brings her some comfort amidst the turmoil she feels. 

As the day comes to a close, Maria shifts her focus toward self-care, knowing she must be gentle with herself as she navigates these complex emotions. By 11:00 PM, she starts her bedtime routine, allowing time for relaxation with a book or light gaming before aiming to drift off to sleep by 2:00 AM. Throughout the day, she remains acutely aware of her emotional state, hoping that maintaining her structured routine will help her gradually reclaim her sense of security as she moves forward on her path toward healing.
