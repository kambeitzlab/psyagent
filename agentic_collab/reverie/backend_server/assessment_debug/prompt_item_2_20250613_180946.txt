In the afternoon, Isabella makes time for herself once again, finding solace in the cozy corner of the cafe to read and reflect. She recognizes that self-care is essential during this challenging period, and engaging in small, comforting activities helps her reconnect with feelings of warmth and hope amidst her sadness.

As the day draws to a close, Isabella gently journals her thoughts, embracing the healing power of words as she navigates her grief.
