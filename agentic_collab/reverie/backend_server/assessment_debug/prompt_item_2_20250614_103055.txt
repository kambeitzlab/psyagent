Recognizing the need to recharge, Isabella allows herself a slow start, sticking to her customary morning routine. She wakes up, prepares a nourishing breakfast, and enjoys her coffee while contemplating the festivities from the day before.

She aims to create a comfortable atmosphere for both her staff and customers, reinforcing the sense of community she values so deeply.

In her schedule, Isabella allocates time for reflection from **12:00 PM to 1:00 PM**, allowing herself to jot down observations about the Valentine's Day event and brainstorm ideas for future gatherings that could enhance the overall experience for her customers. She finds this reflective practice not only stimulating but essential for her growth and connection to the cafe.

Isabella also plans some dedicated study time later in the day, from **3:00 PM to 5:00 PM**, with a focus on her physics coursework. This structured time will be important for her to catch up on material discussed with her friend Maria Lopez and ensure she stays on top of her academic responsibilities.

As the day winds down, Isabella will take time to unwind and relax at home, recognizing that self-care is as crucial as her commitments. She cherishes the relationships she has cultivated, particularly with Maria, since they support each other's endeavors, both academically and personally.

Overall, Isabella Rodriguez is determined to embrace Thursday with intention, balancing her cafe responsibilities, academic commitments, and the much-needed time for rest, all while reflecting on the joy and energy that comes from community and connection.
