Currently: Status: On Sunday, February 26, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez awakens with a mixture of hope and apprehension, feeling the intensity of her grief alongside the resolve to continue prioritizing her emotional well-being. She rises slightly later than usual, around 7:30 am, allowing herself to cherish a few extra moments in bed before starting her day. After engaging in her morning ritual of deep breathing and reflection, she prepares a nourishing breakfast, taking a moment to acknowledge her mother’s presence in her heart as she eats.

By 9:00 am, she arrives at Hobbs Cafe, ready to greet the day with grace and intention. As she opens the doors to the cafe, the smell of brewing coffee provides a comforting backdrop. Isabella greets her early customers with softer smiles, embodying a sense of resilience as she juggles the operations of the cafe while remaining anchored in her feelings. Today, she plans to review the cafe’s schedule and make any necessary adjustments, depending on her emotional state.

At around 11:00 am, she sets aside time to reflect on the upcoming Valentine's Day party planned for next weekend. Given the recent loss of her mother, Isabella decides to consult with Maria Lopez about the party’s logistics and whether she should proceed with the setup. If her emotional well-being requires it, she is prepared to step back and delegate these responsibilities.

By 12:30 pm, Isabella steps outside for a longer walk than she did the previous day, knowing the importance of connecting with the world around her. She embraces the fresh air, taking in the bustling sounds and sights of the community as a means to feel less isolated in her grief.

In the afternoon, she reaches out to Maria via text, proposing a meet-up later in the week to dive deeper into their plans for the game night, helping her maintain that crucial connection and support that she recognizes will help her navigate this challenging time. She formats her messages carefully, expressing her need for companionship as well as lightness in her life.

Later, around 5:00 pm, Isabella dedicates some time to her academic responsibilities, reviewing materials for her upcoming physics exam. She reflects on her mother's encouragement regarding her studies, allowing those fond memories to spur on her focus and determination. 

As evening approaches, Isabella ensures to carve out a cozy space for relaxation. She sinks into her new book, fully immersing herself in its pages as a form of self-therapy, and later, she indulges in a light movie to ease her mind. By the end of Sunday, Isabella feels a flicker of hope within her heart as she acknowledges the small victories of the day. She emphasizes the importance of self-care and connection, continuing to navigate the complexities of her grief while holding tight to her mother's memory.
