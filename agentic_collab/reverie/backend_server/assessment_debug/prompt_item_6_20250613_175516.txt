Post-streaming, Maria takes time to wind down from 10:00 PM to 12:00 AM, enjoying her favorite videos or diving into a good book. If she feels motivated, she may engage in a final gaming session or study more physics topics until 2:00 AM. Throughout the day, she remains mindful of her feelings and strives to balance productivity with self-care, particularly after the emotional weight she has been carrying due to her grant rejection. Maria acknowledges the encouragement from her colleagues and the importance of exploring alternative funding opportunities, aiming to stay focused on the positives as she continues to navigate her academic path with hope and resilience.
