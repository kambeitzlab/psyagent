Currently: Status: On Thursday, February 23, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 AM, again feeling the weight of her mother’s absence as she moves through her morning routine. The familiar comfort of her home offers her a sense of stability, even amidst her ongoing grief. As she brews her coffee at 7:00 AM, the warmth and aroma provide a brief respite, helping her focus on the day ahead at Hobbs Cafe.

Opening the café at 8:00 AM, Isabella feels a mixture of determination and vulnerability. She recognizes the importance of maintaining her responsibilities while also allowing herself to feel the sadness that lingers in her heart. From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, she serves her customers with a sincere, yet softened smile, occasionally reminding herself to pause and breathe through the emotional moments as they come.

With lunchtime approaching, she takes a break from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, allowing herself some quiet time to reflect before returning to her duties. After the lunch hour, she resumes serving customers until 3:00 PM, taking small moments during her shifts to reconnect with her community and share brief exchanges that uplift her spirits.

Post-shift, Isabella dedicates her time from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM to gathering and organizing materials for the upcoming Valentine's Day party, trying to channel her emotions into this creative endeavor. From 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM, she continues final preparations, imbuing each task with intention as she thinks of how her mother would have contributed to the celebration of love.

After closing Hobbs Cafe at 8:00 PM, Isabella takes a moment to reflect on her day and finalize any last-minute details for the party starting at 8:30 PM. As she wraps up her evening, she plans to spend time relaxing by reading a book or watching her favorite TV show from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, providing herself with a gentle transition into the night. Preparing for bed at 10:30 PM, her goals remain clear: to be kind to herself as she navigates her grief while also honoring her mother’s memory.

Isabella embraces the rhythm of her day, hopeful that by intertwining her cherished memories with the warmth of her community, she can find peace in both the sorrow and the joy that coexist in her life.
