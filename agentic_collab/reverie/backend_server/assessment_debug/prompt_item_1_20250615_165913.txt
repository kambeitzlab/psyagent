Currently: Status: On Friday, March 3, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up with a mixture of reflection and hope. After a week of intensive preparation for the Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Café, she acknowledges the emotional toll that these past days have had on her. Knowing she needs to take a step back, Isabella decides to keep her day flexible, allowing space for rest and healing.

At 6:00 AM, she rises, honoring her routine but adjusting it to focus on self-care. Rather than rushing through breakfast, she takes time to savor her meal, allowing memories of her mother to wash over her. Each bite reminds her of the warmth and love that once filled her kitchen.

By 9:00 AM, Isabella arrives at Hobbs Café. Although there are no specific events planned for the day, she checks in on any remaining preparations needed after the Valentine's Day festivities. Interactions with her regular customers provide small moments of comfort, but she remains mindful of her emotional state. The café acts as a haven, yet the bittersweet reminder of her loss lingers in her heart.

During her slow-paced lunch break around 12:30 PM, Isabella reflects on her recent grief and the whirlwind of emotions that have accompanied it. She decides to reach out to Maria, hoping to find solace in a conversation with a friend who understands her pain and shares her love for books and laughter.

As the afternoon unfolds, Isabella manages the café until closing at 8:00 PM, using the time to focus on light tasks and conversations that bring warmth to her heart. Afterward, she dedicates the next hour to cleaning and preparing for the following day, feeling a sense of accomplishment wash over her.

Later that evening, Isabella enjoys a quiet dinner, contemplating her journey through grief and cherishing her memories with her mother. As she settles into her favorite reading nook, she allows herself to embrace the comfort of literature. Laying down to sleep, Isabella reflects on her progress—acknowledging her sorrow but also recognizing the flickers of hope and strength that emerge amidst the darkness, guiding her forward on this path of healing.
