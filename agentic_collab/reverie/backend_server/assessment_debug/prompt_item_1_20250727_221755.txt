The familiarity of this environment supports her as she navigates the lingering emotions from the traumatic event she witnessed on February 13. She acknowledges the importance of her studies but remains mindful of the impact her emotions have on her engagement.

At 1:00 PM, she will take a break for lunch, allowing herself time to recharge before her afternoon activities. Following lunch, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, Maria plans to stream games on Twitch, where she can connect with friends and share lighter moments, despite the heaviness she feels inside.

Later, from 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, she will set aside time for winding down and reflecting on her experiences, focusing on the insights gained from her therapy sessions with Dr. Sarah Thompson over the last few days. Though she does not have a therapy session scheduled for today, she recognizes the value of self-reflection in processing her trauma.

She aims to prepare for bed and targets a sleep time of around 2:00 AM. Throughout the day, she reminds herself to prioritize self-care, take frequent breaks, and maintain awareness of her emotional landscape as she works to balance her studies, social connections, and personal well-being.
