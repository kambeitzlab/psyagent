Currently: Status: On Friday, February 24, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 AM, still feeling the weight of her mother's absence. As she proceeds through her morning routine, she reflects on the success of the Valentine's Day party held the previous evening, hoping it brought joy to her community, even as her heart feels heavy with grief.

By 7:00 AM, she prepares her coffee, the familiar ritual providing a moment of comfort. Opening Hobbs Cafe at 8:00 AM, Isabella serves her customers with a blend of warmth and melancholy. Although she experiences joy from the engaging interactions, a sense of sadness lingers, reminding her of the void left by her mother.

From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Isabella manages the café with a sincere smile while internally reminding herself to take deep breaths and honor her emotions. During her short lunch break from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, she takes a moment of solitude to reflect on the party and how much her mother would have loved the celebrations.

After lunch, she resumes her duties until 3:00 PM, feeling the supportive energy of her customers and community.

In her heart, she feels a mix of accomplishment and lingering sorrow.

As she wraps up her day at Hobbs Cafe, closing the café at 8:00 PM, Isabella takes time to plan for personal healing. From 8:30 PM onward, she engages in reflection, writing down her thoughts and feelings about the party, her mother, and the challenges she faces. From 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, she allows herself some relaxation, immersing in a book or a favorite TV show, seeking solace and distraction.

By 10:30 PM, Isabella begins winding down, preparing for bed with a renewed sense of purpose.
