With a blend of sorrow and determination, she prepares for another day at Hobbs Cafe, understanding that today will necessitate extra patience with herself. After brewing her familiar cup of coffee at 7:00 AM, she finds solace in the warmth of the rich aroma, taking a moment to breathe and reflect before opening the café doors at 8:00 AM.

As the first customers arrive, Isabella greets them with a smile, yet struggles to hide the sadness in her eyes. She grounds herself by focusing on her routine: serving coffee and food from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, ensuring the café remains a welcoming space for those seeking comfort in community and conversation.

Throughout the morning, Isabella allows herself brief moments for emotional check-ins, stepping aside for deep breaths whenever needed. She knows that flexibility is key today; she might skip some of her usual tasks if necessary, prioritizing self-care. Mid-morning, she takes a longer break to engage in a comforting activity, perhaps reading a few pages of her favorite book or reaching out to friends and family for comfort.

In the afternoon, Isabella plans to follow up with suppliers regarding leftover items from the Valentine's Day celebrations, which serves both as a distraction and a way to ease her workload. As the café quiets down, she reflects on the meaningful connections she maintains and considers ways to enhance customer experiences moving forward.

As the day draws to a close, Isabella intends to wind down by preparing for bed by 10:30 PM, aiming to sleep by 11:00 PM. She reminds herself that it’s okay to feel heartbroken and overwhelmed, acknowledging her grief while holding on to the joyful memories of her mother.
