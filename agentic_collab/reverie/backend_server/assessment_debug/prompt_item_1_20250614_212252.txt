Currently: Status: On Sunday, February 26, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up later than usual, allowing herself the grace to rest after the whirlwind of emotions from the past week. She rises at 8:30 AM, embracing the soft light filtering through her window, reminding her that each day is a new beginning. Isabella feels a renewed sense of purpose as she reflects on her mother’s unwavering support, contemplating how she can honor that legacy throughout her day.

Knowing she needs to balance self-care with the operational demands of Hobbs Cafe, Isabella spends a quiet hour sipping tea and journaling her thoughts. Around 10:00 AM, she decides to take the day slow, intending to manage the cafe with a lighter touch. She contacts a trusted friend, Emily, to see if she’s available to help run the cafe for a few hours, allowing Isabella to step back and focus on her emotional wellbeing. 

Isabella communicates with her regular patrons through social media, letting them know that Hobbs Cafe will have modified hours today, opening at 11:00 AM instead of the usual time, with Emily overseeing operations. She feels relieved to have support, recognizing that accepting help is a crucial part of her healing journey.

By 12:00 PM, Isabella makes her way to Hobbs Cafe, arriving just in time to catch the lunch crowd. As she steps inside, the familiar scents of coffee and pastries surround her, providing a comforting backdrop to her day. Although she still carries a heavy heart, seeing her loyal customers brings a sense of warmth. Isabella spends time interacting with them, albeit more quietly than usual, sharing gentle smiles as she serves them.

In the mid-afternoon, around 3:00 PM, Isabella takes a moment for herself. She steps outside to breathe in the fresh air while finding solace in a nearby park that she and her mother loved visiting together. It is there that she allows herself to grieve openly, shedding a few tears as she reflects on her mother’s influence in her life. This quiet space offers her the respite she needs to connect with her own feelings and memories.

Returning to the cafe, Isabella dedicates the late afternoon to privately remembering her mother. She sets aside some time for a small ritual, lighting a candle in honor of her mother, symbolizing her ongoing presence in Isabella’s life. She whispers a few heartfelt words, acknowledging her deep love and gratitude.

As the evening comes, Isabella consciously winds down her day. She plans on preparing a comforting dinner at home, indulging in a meal that her mother often made: a warm, nourishing soup paired with fresh bread. She aims to recreate the comfort it brings, looking forward to curling up with a favorite book afterwards.

By 8:00 PM, Isabella settles into her evening routine, fully dedicating this time to reflection and self-care. She holds space for her feelings, understanding that healing is not a linear path, but rather a gradual journey. As she faces both the joy of her community and the weight of her loss, Isabella reminds herself that it is okay to feel both, carrying the love of her mother with her as she continues to navigate her life.
