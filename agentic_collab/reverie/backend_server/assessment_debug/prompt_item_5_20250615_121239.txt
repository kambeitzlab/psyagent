Currently: Status: On Tuesday, February 21, Isabella Rodriguez awakens at 6:00 AM, though this morning feels different as the weight of her recent loss hangs heavily in the air. She completes her morning rituals and sits down for breakfast at 6:30 AM, taking a moment of silence to honor her mother before mentally gearing up for the day at Hobbs Cafe.

By 7:30 AM, Isabella arrives at the cafe, but rather than her usual routine, she feels a lingering sense of grief that complicates her focus. As she prepares the cafe for the day, she is determined to maintain the warm and inviting atmosphere that her customers cherish, even if her heart feels heavy. The cafe opens promptly at 8:00 AM, and while her smile greets returning patrons, it takes conscious effort to mask the deep sorrow she carries within.

Throughout the morning, Isabella's duties continue as she serves customers, but she finds herself occasionally distracted, struggling to keep her mind on the tasks at hand while thoughts of her mother resurface. The morning passes, and at 12:30 PM, she takes a short lunch breakâ€”an essential time for her to reflect on the love and support surrounding her in the cafe community.

Returning to her responsibilities until 4:00 PM, Isabella remains dedicated to ensuring the smooth operation of Hobbs Cafe. After closing, she allocates time to finalize any last-minute preparations for the Valentine's Day party, which now feels bittersweet given her current emotional state. Isabella carefully reviews customer feedback from the previous event and aims to keep the planning process organized, knowing it is essential to honor the hard work she has already put into the celebration.

As the cafe closes at 8:00 PM and the last customers are served, Isabella tidies up, feeling a mix of accomplishment and sorrow. She departs from Hobbs Cafe around 8:30 PM, arriving home to a comforting dinner at 9:00 PM. In the quiet of her apartment, she allows herself to mourn, reminiscing over meals shared with her mother and the advice she often gave.

Though the day proves to be a struggle, Isabella resolves to take things one step at a time, giving herself grace as she learns to navigate her grief while fulfilling her responsibilities at the cafe. Acknowledging the difficult emotional journey ahead, she finds solace in the strength of her community and the memories of her mother, embracing the hope of finding joy amidst the pain.
