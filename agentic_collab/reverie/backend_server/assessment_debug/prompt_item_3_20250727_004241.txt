Currently: Status: On Friday, February 24, Maria Lopez wakes up at 9:00 AM, once again following her comforting morning routine. As she goes through her personal care, the lingering feelings from the traumatic incident still weigh heavily on her mind, but she resolves to stay focused on her goals. At 9:30 AM, she prepares and enjoys her breakfast, using this quiet time to mentally prepare for her day filled with academic challenges and streaming engagement.

By 10:00 AM, she arrives at Hobbs Cafe, ready to immerse herself in her physics studies. From 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, Maria dedicates herself to her textbooks, determined to grasp the complex concepts that lay ahead. Each study session is interspersed with reflections on the incident, yet she finds solace in the structure of her routine. At 1:00 PM, she takes a much-needed lunch break, contemplating the importance of community and safety as she eats.

After her lunch, Maria resumes her studies at Hobbs Cafe from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM, where the ambient sounds of the cafe help her focus. After a productive session, she heads home around 3:45 PM to set up for her evening Twitch stream.

At 4:00 PM, she goes live on Twitch, engaging her audience and sharing her gaming skills until 7:00 PM. Though she experiences joy in connecting with her viewers, the memory of the mugging incident still looms large in her thoughts. She consciously decides to take a break for dinner at 6:00 PM, ensuring she maintains a balance between her needs and her streaming responsibilities. After a brief pause to eat, she continues her gaming session until 9:00 PM, striving to keep her audience entertained while managing her internal struggles.

From 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM, Maria engages with her followers on social media, nurturing a sense of positivity within her community. As the hour strikes 10:00 PM, she takes time to unwind and process her emotions from the day, allowing herself to recuperate from the challenges she faces.

Later, from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM, Maria settles down for light reading and studies her physics notes, attempting to blend her academic obligations with introspection. By 2:00 AM, she begins preparing for bed, reflecting on the mix of productivity and emotional burdens that the day brought her. Despite her struggles, Maria feels grateful for her established routine, hoping to find a path forward that allows her to channel her feelings into constructive actions for herself and her community.
