She prepares a nourishing breakfast at 6:30 AM, taking a moment to reflect on her mother's memory while savoring the familiar ritual. Each bite serves as a reminder of her intention to prioritize her emotional health, even amidst the sadness that lingers deeply within her heart.

By 7:30 AM, she arrives at Hobbs Café, ready to open for business at 8:00 AM. The inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee envelops her, providing a fleeting sense of comfort. As she greets customers with her signature warm smile, she feels the juxtaposition of joy and sorrow in every interaction. Serving pastries and coffee until noon, Isabella finds solace in the connections she makes, each smile from a patron a reclaiming of the community support that sustains her.

The memories of happier times spent with friends like Maria feel bittersweet, now mixed with the profound sadness of her mother’s passing. Yet, she holds tightly to the belief that through the pain, she will find strength, and the joyous memories will resurface over time.
