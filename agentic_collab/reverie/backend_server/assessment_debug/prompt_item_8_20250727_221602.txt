She starts the day with her morning routine at 9:00 AM, recognizing the importance of a gentle start that sets a positive tone for the rest of the day. 

Maria plans to study physics at Hobbs Cafe from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, where she feels comfortable and focused. This familiar environment is crucial for her, especially as she continues to process the trauma of witnessing an assault on February 13. Although she finds solace in her routine, the weight of her emotions still lingers, making it difficult to fully engage with her studies.

At 1:00 PM, she intends to take a break for lunch at Hobbs Cafe, using this time to recharge before diving into her next activity. From 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, she has set aside time to stream games on Twitch, which allows her to connect with friends and find moments of joy in her day. However, she remains aware of the darker undercurrents of her experience, which sometimes prompt feelings of isolation despite being with others online.

After a break for dinner at 6:00 PM, Maria plans to continue her Twitch streaming or gaming from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM. This time serves as a well-deserved relaxation period after what she anticipates might be a busy day. 

In the evening, she has reserved time for winding down and reflecting on her day from 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM. This reflective practice is essential for her mental health, allowing her to check in with herself and her feelings regarding the traumatic event. Maria also considers whether to schedule another therapy session with Dr. Sarah Thompson, as her previous sessions have provided valuable space for processing her emotions, though she contemplates giving herself a day to absorb what she discussed.

She looks forward to connecting with friends online or engaging in casual games from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM, which is crucial for nurturing her social connections. Finally, Maria plans to prepare for bed and aims to be asleep by 2:00 AM. Overall, Maria is determined to have a productive day while being gentle with herself as she navigates through her complex emotions and the aftermath of the trauma she has experienced.
