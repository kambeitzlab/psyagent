Rising early at 6:00 AM, she takes a moment to breathe deeply, acknowledging her emotions. Understanding the importance of self-care, she prepares breakfast at 6:30 AM, allowing herself to reflect on the bittersweet memories of her mother while fueling her body for the day ahead.

By 7:00 AM, Isabella reviews her schedule for Hobbs Cafe, mentally preparing herself for the day’s responsibilities. She recalls her typical routine of opening the café by 8:00 AM and understands the necessity of continuing her work amidst her grief.

From 8:00 AM until noon, she busies herself behind the counter, blending compassion and resilience as she serves coffee and pastries. She draws strength from the regular patrons and their conversations, yet the sadness lingers in the background.

At noon, Isabella takes a short lunch break, using this time to pause and reflect on her emotional state. After her break, she returns to the café at 12:30 PM and continues her afternoon shift until 3:00 PM, where the hustle and bustle of customers provides a temporary distraction from her sorrow.

From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, she allocates specific time to review how the Valentine’s Day party went, gathering feedback and considering any follow-ups needed. Isabella processes these reflections with a blend of pride and grief, channeling her mother's spirit into her work.

Between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM, Isabella serves the afternoon crowd, each interaction serving as a gentle reminder of the love she wishes to celebrate. By 6:00 PM, she begins the closing procedures, preparing to end another day at Hobbs Cafe, which will officially close at 8:00 PM.

After finishing her workday, Isabella plans to unwind at home around 8:30 PM. She is determined to carve out personal time to relax, whether through reading or spending time with family, if they are available. Isabella sets these intentions, mindful of the importance of honoring both her responsibilities and her emotional health as she navigates through her grief.

As she reflects on her day before bedtime, from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM, Isabella revisits her reminders and ensures she has set aside moments for herself amidst her work.
