As she rises, she reflects on the importance of self-care, knowing that it’s essential to prioritize her well-being during such a difficult time. She begins her morning with a gentle cup of tea instead of coffee, embracing the quietness of her home and acknowledgment of her grief.

At 8:00 AM, she prepares a light breakfast, taking time to savor each bite as she reminisces about the love shared with her mother. This moment of solitude is both soothing and bittersweet, as she continues to navigate her sorrow. As she looks around her kitchen, she notices small reminders of her mother interwoven in her daily life, deepening her resolve to cherish the beautiful memories.

Isabella takes the morning to unwind and process her emotions, spending time journaling at home. By 10:00 AM, she allows herself to engage in reflective writing, using this opportunity to pour out her feelings and contemplate her mother's legacy. She sets aside the stress of cafe operations for the morning, permitting herself this sacred time to heal.

Around noon, Isabella heads to Hobbs Cafe, arriving at 12:30 PM. Although the cafe doesn’t open until 1:00 PM, she uses this time to finalize the last-minute preparations for the upcoming Valentine’s Day party. This includes checking on any supplies and making sure that everything is in order for her loyal patrons. Despite her sadness, she finds comfort in the familiar space, where the love and laughter of her customers always resonate.

As the afternoon unfolds, Isabella devotes herself to addressing any leftover tasks from the party, meeting with staff members and discussing their roles in the upcoming event. Throughout these interactions, she aims to maintain a warm atmosphere, even while carrying the weight of her grief.

After completing her work at the cafe, she takes a moment to breathe and regroup. By 5:00 PM, Isabella scatters her thoughts on potential improvements for the cafe, jotting down ideas while reflecting on how best to honor her mother's memory in her work. This moment becomes a vessel for her creative expression, allowing her to channel her emotions positively.

As the evening approaches, Isabella leaves the cafe by 8:00 PM, feeling a sense of fulfillment from her efforts yet still grappling with her heartache. Upon returning home, she treats herself to a simple dinner, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. At 9:00 PM, Isabella sits quietly in her living room, lighting a candle in remembrance of her mother, allowing herself to feel the warmth of both loss and love.

Finally, by 10:00 PM, she dedicates time to unwind, choosing to watch a comforting movie that her mother loved.
