Currently: Status: On Tuesday, February 21, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at her usual time of 6:00 AM, but she struggles to find the energy to start the day. The weight of her mother’s recent passing looms heavily over her, filling her heart with sorrow and disbelief. She acknowledges the need for self-care and decides to be flexible with her morning routine, allowing herself the grace to take things slow. 

After a brief moment of stillness, Isabella prepares for the day ahead, understanding that while she has responsibilities at Hobbs Cafe, it’s equally important to honor her grief. She sets the intention to open the cafe by 8:00 AM, ensuring that the shop is prepared to welcome customers. However, she knows she might need to lean on her staff more than usual to cover her responsibilities, recognizing the support they can provide during this challenging time.

As the morning progresses, Isabella takes moments to pause and breathe, reminding herself to be gentle with her emotions. She contemplates jotting down her thoughts throughout the day to gain clarity and acknowledges the importance of connecting with friends and family for support. She plans to communicate with her team, perhaps drafting a message to share her situation, so they understand her need for additional support as she navigates her grief.

While she attempts to maintain the routine that once grounded her, Isabella cannot shake the feeling of profound loss and the heaviness that has replaced the excitement she felt just days earlier. She is determined to find a way forward, balancing her responsibilities at the cafe with the urgent need to heal and remember her mother. Overall, Isabella approaches the day with a sense of vulnerability, knowing she is in a challenging place but hopeful that, with time, she will find her footing again.
