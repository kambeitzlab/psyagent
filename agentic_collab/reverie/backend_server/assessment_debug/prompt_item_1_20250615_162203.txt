Currently: Status: Maria Lopez is stepping into *Tuesday, February 21*, determined to maintain her focus on her studies while navigating the emotional challenges that have surfaced since the rejection of her research grant application. A mix of excitement and anxiety surrounds her as she approaches her physics exam, compelling her to dedicate substantial time to her review and practice sessions. 

Maria's day kicks off with her well-established morning routine, which she aims to complete by **9:00 AM**. Following this, she'll have breakfast and prepare for her day, allowing herself some time to gather her thoughts before heading out. By **10:00 AM**, she plans to settle into Hobbs Cafe for her first study session aimed at physics, running until **1:00 PM**.

After her focused two-and-a-half-hour study block, Maria has set aside time for a restorative snack break from **1:00 PM to 1:30 PM**. Refreshed and refocused, she will dive back into her studies from **1:30 PM to 3:30 PM**. Once again, she will return home after this session around **3:30 PM** for a light lunch before transitioning to her evening relaxation routine. 

From **4:00 PM to 7:00 PM**, Maria looks forward to unwinding with her Twitch streaming and gaming, recognizing the importance of this time to recharge her mental batteries. Dinner will either be a home-cooked treat or a quick grab from Hobbs Cafe around **6:00 PM**. Following dinner, she’ll continue her streaming activities until **9:00 PM**, inviting friends to join her for additional gaming until **12:00 AM**.

As the night concludes, Maria is mindful to carve out a wind-down period for herself from **12:00 AM to 2:00 AM**, engaging with social media and watching videos, helping her to process her feelings and the day’s events before heading to bed.
