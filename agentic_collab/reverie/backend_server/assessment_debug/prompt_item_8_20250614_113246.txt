Rising early at 6:00 AM, she begins her day with her usual morning routine, finding solace in the familiar rhythm of her life. At 7:00 AM, she enjoys her breakfast and a steaming cup of coffee, using this tranquil moment to reflect on her week and gather the strength needed to face the day.

Returning home at 8:30 PM, Isabella prepares dinner with care, embracing the ordinary tasks as a grounding ritual. After dinner, she allows herself to unwind from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, allowing the soothing escape of a book or her favorite television shows to momentarily ease her mind. As she prepares for bed, she reflects on the balance of duty and grief she navigates daily, acknowledging that while the weight of her mother's passing remains, she is determined to find joy in the connections she cherishes and the memories she holds dear.
