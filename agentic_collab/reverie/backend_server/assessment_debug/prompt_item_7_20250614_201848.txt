Currently: Status: On Monday, February 27, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up promptly at 6:00 AM, determined to stick to her morning routine as a way to find some stability amidst her grief. By 6:30 AM, she prepares a simple breakfast, taking a moment to breathe deeply and gather her thoughts. Reflecting on her mother's legacy, she reminds herself of the importance of self-care during this challenging time.

Arriving at Hobbs Cafe by 8:00 AM, Isabella begins her day by checking in with her staff, ensuring that everything is running smoothly. She leads a brief meeting to discuss the aftermath of the Valentine's Day party, allowing her team to express their thoughts and feelings about the event. As she reviews stock from the party, she feels a mix of pride and heartache, knowing that her efforts were integral to the celebration, even as it now carries a bittersweet weight.

Throughout her work hours, Isabella makes a conscious effort to take regular breaks to check in with herself emotionally.

She has set aside time to reflect on her emotions through journaling, allowing herself the space to process the heaviness she carries. Before 10:30 PM, she aims to prepare for bed, holding onto a sense of peace as she honors her mother's memory while also nurturing her own healing path. Isabella embraces the day with a mixed heartâ€”grateful for her routines and the love of her community, yet acutely aware of her loss.
