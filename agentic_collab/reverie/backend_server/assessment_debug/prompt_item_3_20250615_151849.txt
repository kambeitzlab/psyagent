Currently: Status: On Friday, February 24, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez rises at 6:00 am, feeling the lingering heaviness of grief from her mother's passing. She navigates her morning routine with a sense of reflection, allowing her heart to process the memories that flood her mind, reminding her of the love and warmth she experienced with her mother. By 6:30 am, she prepares a simple breakfast, savoring the quiet solitude that grants her time to gather her thoughts for the day ahead.

Arriving at Hobbs Cafe by 7:30 am, Isabella senses the familiar atmosphere but today it carries an echo of her sorrow. As she unlocks the doors at 8:00 am, she recalls her mother’s words, encouraging her to embrace life, even in the midst of heavy emotions. She serves coffee and pastries to the early morning crowd until 12:00 pm, finding moments of solace in the smiles of her customers, even as her heart carries the weight of loss.

During her lunch break at 12:30 pm, Isabella retreats to a quiet corner of the café, allowing herself to breathe and reflect on her mental state. The therapy session she had with Dr. Sarah Thompson yesterday at 2:00 pm occupies her mind, reminding her of the importance of processing her feelings and applying what she learned during that conversation. As she prepares for the afternoon, she acknowledges the planning required for the Valentine’s Day party, a reminder of her responsibilities even amidst her grief.

In the afternoon, Isabella remains committed to her work, engaging with customers until 4:00 pm. From 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm, she shifts her focus to following up on the Valentine’s Day preparations, gathering the last-minute materials necessary for the upcoming celebration. As the café closes at 8:00 pm, Isabella meticulously cleans and prepares for the weekend, mindful of the gentle balance she's trying to maintain between her responsibilities and her emotional well-being.

Heading home by 9:00 pm, Isabella allows herself to unwind with a light dinner. She plans to spend her evening enjoying a comfort book or a movie, giving herself the space to process the whirlwind of emotions she's navigating. Remembering the joy she shared with her mother, she holds onto those precious memories, while recognizing the importance of self-compassion as she moves through this challenging time. Each day is a step forward, and though the path of healing is uncertain, Isabella remains committed to honoring her mother’s legacy while taking care of her own emotional health.
