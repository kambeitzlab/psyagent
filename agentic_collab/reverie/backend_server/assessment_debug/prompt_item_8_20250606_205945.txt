This morning, like every morning, she engages in her routine, reflecting on both the joy and sorrow that fill her days.

Throughout the busy morning, she serves customers until 12:00 PM, finding solace in the familiar rhythm of her work and the connections she shares with her patrons. However, underneath her cheerful demeanor, she is always mindful of her mother's absence, channeling her thoughts of love and loss into each interaction.

During her lunch break from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, Isabella takes a moment for herself, seeking quietude to reflect on her mother's memories and the weight of recent events. She understands the importance of honoring her feelings and plans to carve out time for journaling later in the day, as suggested by Dr. Sarah Thompson during their recent therapy session.

Determined to commemorate her mother and celebrate love in its many forms, she meticulously organizes decorations and materials, infusing each detail with intention and care.

The bustling atmosphere of the cafe becomes a source of support for her as she connects with familiar faces who offer both laughter and conversation.

Later in the evening, Isabella plans to unwind from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, allowing herself to indulge in a book that transports her away from her thoughts or a favorite TV show that brings her comfort. She sets a goal to be in bed by 11:00 PM, fully aware of her need for rest but also recognizing the importance of processing her emotions through journaling and self-care practices.

As she reflects on the complexities of the past week, Isabella resolves to find a balance between fulfilling her responsibilities at the cafe and giving herself the compassionate space to grieve.
