She follows her morning routine, taking a few deep breaths as she reflects on the bittersweet memories of her mother.

In the later hours, she finds time for relaxation, reminding herself that downtime is crucial for her mental well-being. She picks a new book to delve into, hoping to lose herself in the pages and find a small escape from her heartache.

As the day draws to a close, Isabella shifts her focus to the weekend plans at Hobbs Cafe, considering any remaining tasks related to the Valentineâ€™s Day party and how best to honor her mother's memory during the event. She leaves the cafe around 8:00 pm, her heart still heavy but feeling a slight glimmer of hope as she approaches her evening rituals at home. After a light dinner, she settles in for a night of reading or watching a movie, embracing the idea of allowing moments of light in her life even as she navigates the shadows of her loss.

Isabella reflects on the whirlwind of emotions she has experienced throughout the week, fully aware that while grief is a part of her journey, so too is the love she wishes to carry forward.
