After reflecting on the tumultuous events of the previous week, including his challenging dissertation defense, he is committed to sticking to a structured routine that promotes both productivity and mental well-being.

Klaus begins his day by rising at 7:00 AM and following his established morning routine, recognizing the importance of grounding himself in familiar practices. By 8:00 AM, he heads to the library at Oak Hill College, eager to dive back into researching resources for his paper on gentrification. From 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM, Klaus immerses himself in literature, collecting valuable insights that will support his writing efforts.

Once lunchtime arrives at noon, Klaus takes a break at Hobbs Cafe to recharge, allowing himself to step away from the intellectual pressures of his work. After lunch, he returns to writing from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM, a block of time he has carved out to make significant progress on his research paper.

At 4:30 PM, Klaus reviews the notes he has taken throughout the day, consolidating his thoughts and reflecting on what he has accomplished. He then looks forward to dinner at 5:00 PM, once again at Hobbs Cafe, which has become a comfortable retreat.
