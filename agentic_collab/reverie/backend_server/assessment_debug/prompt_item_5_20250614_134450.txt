Currently: Status: On Sunday, February 26, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez awakens at 6:00 am, the soft light of morning providing a gentle reminder of the world outside, though her heart still feels the weight of the recent loss. After completing her usual morning routine, she enjoys a quiet breakfast, allowing herself a moment of peace to reflect on the emotional rollercoaster of the past week.

At 8:00 am, Isabella opens Hobbs Cafe, maintaining her warm smile as she greets the early patrons. Today, however, feels different. The bustling atmosphere of the café brings her comfort, but she is acutely aware of the solitude that follows her every move. As the morning progresses, she takes time to engage with her customers while subtly gathering feedback from the Valentine’s Day party—processing what went well and what could be honed for future events.

By noon, Isabella takes a well-deserved lunch break, reminding herself to prioritize self-care amidst the busyness of her responsibilities. She spends this time reflecting on her mother’s spirit and the love that surrounded yesterday's event. Following this introspective moment, at 1:00 pm, she returns to the café, where the familiar routine continues with serving and interacting with her loyal customers. Today, while she pours coffee and takes orders, there is a renewed sense of connection, as she feels her mother’s presence in the laughter and joy around her.

Around 3:00 pm, Isabella checks in on the café's tidiness and functionality, being mindful of her energy levels. She recognizes the importance of pacing herself while navigating this difficult period. At 5:00 pm, she takes a moment to enjoy a coffee again, allowing her thoughts to drift as she starts planning out her week—the schedule of Hobbs Cafe remains unchanged with openings at 8:00 am and closing at 8:00 pm.

After closing at 8:00 pm, Isabella looks forward to her evening alone, crafting space for herself to unwind. She considers indulging in comforting activities such as reading or listening to soothing music, nurturing her heart and allowing herself to grieve. Today, Isabella embraces the process of healing, acknowledging that it takes time and that asking for support is part of this journey. Each day spent in her café, filled with warm connections, serves as both a tribute to her mother and a testament to her resilience.
