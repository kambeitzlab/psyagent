While reflecting on the event, she acknowledges the mix of joy and sorrow that accompanied her during the celebration. Isabella starts her morning as planned, waking up at 6:00 AM, preparing breakfast, and enjoying a moment of peace with her coffee before heading to the cafe.

Arriving at Hobbs Cafe by 8:00 AM, Isabella is focused on both cleaning up following the party and ensuring the caf√© is fully operational for her customers. She engages with patrons from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM, using this time not only to serve coffee and breakfast but also to gather feedback about the Valentine's Day celebration. These interactions help her feel connected to her community and offer a brief escape from her grief.
