After completing her personal care, she feels a familiar mix of resolve and apprehension, the emotional weight from the traumatic incident lingering in her mind. At 9:30 AM, she prepares and enjoys her breakfast, using this quiet moment to mentally gear up for another day filled with academic challenges and streaming engagement.

By 10:00 AM, she arrives at Hobbs Cafe, ready to dive back into her physics studies. For the next three hours, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, she channels her focus into her textbooks, determined to solidify her understanding of complex concepts while still grappling with her feelings regarding the mugging incident. At 1:00 PM, she takes a well-deserved lunch break, reflecting on the significance of community and safety over her meal.

Following her lunch, Maria resumes her studies at Hobbs Cafe from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM, aided by the cafe's structured environment. Each completed topic provides a small sense of accomplishment, helping her navigate her emotions. She returns home around 3:45 PM, intent on preparing for her evening streaming schedule.

At exactly 4:00 PM, Maria goes live on Twitch, engaging her audience in her gaming world until 7:00 PM. Despite the joy of connecting with her viewers, the memory of the mugging still looms over her. She decides to take a break for dinner around 6:00 PM, balancing her needs with her streaming responsibilities.

Later, from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM, Maria settles down for some light reading and revises her physics notes, attempting to blend her academic commitments with self-reflection. By 2:00 AM, she prepares for bed, her thoughts still wrestling with the mix of productivity and emotional heaviness she's experienced throughout the day. Grateful for her established routine, she remains hopeful that, moving forward, she can channel her feelings into constructive actions for herself and her community.
