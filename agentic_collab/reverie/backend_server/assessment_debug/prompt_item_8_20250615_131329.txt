At 5:00 PM, he’ll have dinner—considering his options between Hobbs Cafe or a more relaxed meal at home. If there's a study group planned for 6:00 PM, Klaus is determined to attend, recognizing the value in discussing his evolving ideas with peers, particularly as their perspectives may provide clarity and inspiration after his recent setback.
