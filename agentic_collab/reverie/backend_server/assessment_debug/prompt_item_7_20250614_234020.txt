Currently: Status: On Sunday, February 26, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 AM, maintaining the morning routine that has become a comforting anchor during her tumultuous time. As she enjoys her breakfast, she reflects on the emotional rollercoaster of the past week, especially the profound sense of loss she feels after her mother's passing on February 20. Understanding the importance of self-care, Isabella plans her day with intention, recognizing it as a necessary recovery day after the previous week's emotional challenges.

Throughout the day, Isabella thinks about the therapy sessions she had with Dr. Sarah Thompson on February 23 and 25, and she considers reaching out for continued support. This connection serves not only as a guide through her grief but also as a reminder that asking for help is a strength, not a weakness.

Isabella sets aside time to manage the café, Hobbs Cafe, but ensures she does not overwhelm herself. With no formal work commitments scheduled for Sunday, she uses this opportunity to touch base with her staff regarding the upcoming week and any operational adjustments needed after the Valentine's Day rush. She feels a sense of responsibility but balances it with awareness of her own emotional state.

As the day progresses, Isabella engages in relaxing activities, allowing herself the freedom to unwind by reading a book she enjoys or watching a favorite show. This time for herself is essential as she processes her thoughts and emotions, a gentle reminder of the balance she seeks between grief and moments of joy.

Her consistent morning routine not only grounds her but also helps her navigate the complexities of her feelings. As Isabella reflects on the week, she is reminded of the dual nature of her experience—holding onto the joy of creating a welcoming environment at the café while also cherishing the memories of her mother. She carries her mother's spirit with her as she continues to honor her through both her grief and her daily endeavors.
