Currently: Status: On Thursday, February 23, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 7:00 AM, consciously deciding to allow herself extra rest in light of the emotional toll from the recent days. Her heart still heavy from her mother's passing, she prepares a light breakfast and savors her coffee, taking solace in the ritual but feeling the sadness lingering in the background.

Knowing she has a light schedule ahead, Isabella heads to Hobbs Cafe around 8:30 AM, adjusting her typical morning routine to honor her emotional needs. She spends the morning quietly reflecting on her grief while prepping for a less hectic day, checking in with her friend Maria Lopez as planned, and sharing some of her feelings. Their conversation helps fortify her spirit, reminding her that she isn't alone in this process.

From 9:00 AM until 12:00 PM, Isabella assists with the usual cafe operations, focusing on maintaining connections with the customers while being gentle with herself. She recognizes the balance she must strike between her responsibilities and allowing herself to grieve. During this time, the warmth of conversations and the hustle of the cafe provide a temporary refuge from her sorrow.

After a short break for lunch at 12:30 PM, Isabella nurtures her mental health by dedicating the afternoon to self-care. From 1:00 PM onward, she opts to spend time reading and reflecting, creating a safe space to process her emotions. This quiet time is crucial, as she feels it helps ground her amid the chaos of her thoughts.

In the late afternoon, around 4:00 PM, Isabella briefly returns to the cafe to confirm preparations for the upcoming events, but she ensures to keep the workload manageable. As her shift ends at 6:00 PM, she makes a promise to continue prioritizing her wellness.

Once home by 6:30 PM, Isabella decides to prepare a simple dinner. The evening is reserved for a gentle winding down with her favorite show, allowing herself to disconnect from the day. By 10:00 PM, she reflects on the importance of embracing her feelings of grief while continuing to lean on the support of friends.

Throughout the day, Isabella reminds herself that it's okay to change her schedule as she navigates her healing journey. She finds comfort in both the structured elements of her routine and the flexibility to grieve, acknowledging each step forward—no matter how small—as a victory in the face of loss.
