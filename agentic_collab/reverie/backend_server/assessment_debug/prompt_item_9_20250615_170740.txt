Currently: Status: On Sunday, March 5, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes with a sense of heaviness in her heart, aware of the emotional toll the past weeks have taken on her. She takes a moment to breathe deeply, reminding herself of the grace she needs to offer herself in this time of grief. Instead of rushing to her usual morning routine, she decides to take a slower approach, allowing herself to reflect on her feelings.

At 7:00 AM, Isabella enjoys a quiet breakfast at home, savoring the comfort of familiar food while allowing nostalgia to wash over her. She thinks of her mother and the meals they used to share, recognizing that today might bring moments of both sadness and peace.

Throughout the morning, she contemplates her plans—or rather, the lack thereof. Knowing she needs rest and self-care, Isabella spends the late morning engaged in light reading and journaling her thoughts at home, creating a safe space for her emotions to flow. Around 11:00 AM, she decides to take a short walk, hoping the fresh air will provide clarity and a sense of calm.

At approximately 1:00 PM, Isabella makes her way to Hobbs Café, aware of the Valentine's Day preparations ahead but feeling the need to lighten her workload. Upon arrival, she has a brief meeting with her staff to discuss the upcoming party and how they can collaboratively manage the tasks without overwhelming her. They brainstorm decorations and responsibilities while sharing moments of laughter, reminding Isabella of the joy that community can bring even in difficult times.

Later in the afternoon, around 3:00 PM, Isabella dedicates some time to work on the Valentine’s Day decorations, allowing the creative process to distract her mind from her grief. While she engages in these activities, she finds brief moments of happiness and connection with her surroundings.

As the day winds down, Isabella closes the café at 6:00 PM and heads home. The evening is spent in solitude, with a light dinner followed by another session of reading in her cozy nook. Although threads of sorrow still linger, she acknowledges the importance of enjoying these small escapes.

Before heading to bed, Isabella reflects on her day with gratitude for the moments of connection she had, even amidst grief. She acknowledges the journey ahead and reminds herself to honor her feelings while continuing to seek joy and support from her friends and community. With this understanding, she lays down to sleep, holding onto the memories of her mother tightly, resolved to keep moving forward.
