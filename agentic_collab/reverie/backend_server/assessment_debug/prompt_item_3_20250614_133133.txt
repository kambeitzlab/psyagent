Currently: Status: On Wednesday, February 22, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 am, determined to greet the day with the same dedication she has always shown. Yet, the absence of her mother looms heavy in her heart, casting a shadow over her morning routine. After completing her familiar rituals, she prepares breakfast at 7:00 am—an act that feels both comforting and bittersweet as she reflects on the warmth of her mother's presence in the kitchen.

By 8:00 am, she sits down with her physics lecture notes, using this time to dive into her studies. As she focuses on her coursework, she finds solace in the mental challenge, attempting to push aside the grief that lingers just beneath the surface. The routine of learning serves as a distraction from her pain, allowing her to temporarily escape into the world of equations and theories.

At 10:00 am, Isabella shifts her focus to the café, ready to tackle the inventory check she prioritized. The clutter of decorations and supplies from the Valentine's Day party still fills the back area of Hobbs Cafe, and she approaches the task with a mix of determination and nostalgia. Each box she sorts through stirs memories of her efforts to create a joyful atmosphere, reminding her of her mother's enthusiastic support.

Throughout the day, Isabella plans to engage with customers to gather feedback about the party, eager to find the connection that makes her feel closer to her mother’s spirit. By taking time to chat and listen to their thoughts, she hopes to bring a sense of community to the café, just as her mother would have wanted. 

In her mind, she acknowledges the necessity of self-care, reminding herself that grief is a journey and it is okay to pause and take care of her emotional needs. She plans to incorporate relaxation into her day, even amid her busy schedule. As Isabella navigates this challenging day, she embraces both her responsibilities and the memories of her mother, allowing herself to feel the full spectrum of emotions while honoring the love that will guide her through the days ahead.
