Following a difficult week marked by challenges surrounding his dissertation defense, Klaus acknowledges the importance of maintaining a structured routine that balances his academic responsibilities with self-care. 

He begins his day at 7:00 AM, sticking to his established morning routine to create a sense of stability.

During this time, he intends to refine his understanding of gentrification and gather additional resources to strengthen his research paper.

He prepares for bed by 11:00 PM, carrying with him a sense of hope and the understanding that he is on a journey to redefine success and manage his anxiety.

Klaus is committed to applying the skills he has learned in cognitive behavioral therapy, recognizing that his self-worth should not be tied solely to academic performance.
