After a challenging week starting with the electrical fire at Hobbs Cafe, she wakes up later than usual, allowing herself a leisurely morning in pursuit of self-care.

She recognizes the need for a manageable schedule that balances her operational responsibilities with self-care. By keeping things light this week, she hopes to approach her work with renewed clarity and focus.
