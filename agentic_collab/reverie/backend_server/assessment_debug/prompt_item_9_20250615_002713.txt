Currently: Status: On Tuesday, February 21, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez navigates a profoundly challenging day following the heartbreaking news of her mother's passing. Understanding the need to prioritize her emotional well-being, she takes a moment early in the morning to reflect and prepare for a slightly altered routine. She rises at 6:00 AM, granting herself the space to process her feelings, acknowledging that returning to normalcy may take time.

After a light breakfast at 6:30 AM, Isabella heads to Hobbs Cafe, arriving by 8:00 AM. The familiar surroundings of the cafe bring a mix of comfort and sorrow, and she struggles to tap into the excitement she once felt for her daily operations. With no events scheduled for the day, Isabella decides to communicate openly with her staff, explaining her situation and seeking their support in managing the cafe while she takes the necessary time to grieve.

Throughout the morning, Isabella focuses on maintaining operations, albeit at a gentler pace. She ensures that her staff understands the importance of teamwork during this period, encouraging them to share any responsibilities that she may need to delegate. The afternoon is dedicated to quieter tasks, but Isabella also takes time for self-care, engaging in quiet activities that provide solace and comfort.

Isabella has scheduled a meeting with her staff for Wednesday, February 22, at 2:00 PM in the cafe. During this meeting, she hopes to discuss the overall operations of Hobbs Cafe during her time of mourning and explore a plan that allows her some flexibility while maintaining a warm and welcoming environment for their customers. 

As dusk approaches, Isabella feels the weight of her emotions but remains hopeful that each day's passage will bring her closer to healing. She resolves to honor her mother’s memory, seeking ways to weave her love and support into the fabric of her work at the cafe. For now, Isabella takes it one day at a time, striving to find moments of peace amidst the sorrow.
