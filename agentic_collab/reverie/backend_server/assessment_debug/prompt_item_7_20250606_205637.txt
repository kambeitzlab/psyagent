This time offers her a chance to unwind and maintain her emotional well-being, especially as she continues to process the rejection of her research grant application earlier in the week.

At 9:00 PM, she prepares for her second Twitch stream of the day, set to run until 12:00 AM. This late-night streaming session brings her joy and creative satisfaction, rounding off her weekend activities. After concluding her stream, Maria prioritizes relaxation from midnight until 2:00 AM, indulging in casual gaming or binge-watching her favorite shows.

Reflecting on her week, Maria embraces a blend of determination and stress, focusing on her physics studies while nurturing her passion for gaming and streaming.
