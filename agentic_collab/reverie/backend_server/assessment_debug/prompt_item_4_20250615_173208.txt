With a busy schedule ahead, she intends to balance her cafe duties with relaxation and preparation for the upcoming week.

After closing the cafe at 4:00 pm, Isabella heads home, looking forward to a quiet evening that includes a light dinner, reading, or perhaps watching some TV. She plans to unwind and mentally prepare for the week ahead, valuing the downtime after a busy weekend.

Isabella is feeling grateful for her friends, the warmth of the cafe community, and the personal growth that comes with balancing work, studies, and social life. Though nervous about her upcoming physics exam, she remains optimistic, allowing herself to embrace each moment as it comes.
