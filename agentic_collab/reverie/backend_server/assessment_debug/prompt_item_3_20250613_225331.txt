Currently: Status: Maria Lopez is embracing another busy day on Tuesday, February 14. She's continuing her journey toward completing her physics degree while streaming games on Twitch to earn some extra income. Staying true to her routine, she plans to wake up at 9:00 AM and complete her morning activities to start the day fresh. With classes scheduled from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM at Oak Hill College, Maria is determined to be prepared with all her necessary materials. 

After classes, she looks forward to grabbing lunch at Hobbs Cafe around 1:15 PM, a convenient spot she enjoyed the day before. Following lunch, Maria has set aside time to study her physics notes from 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM, once again choosing the café as her study location to reinforce her understanding of the material.

Once her study session wraps up, she will head home by 5:30 PM to prepare for dinner, which she plans to eat at 6:00 PM. After a restorative dinner, she is excited about her Twitch streaming session scheduled from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM and has made a mental note to ensure her streaming software is fully set up before she goes live.

After her initial streaming session, Maria intends to take a break to interact with her chat or relax between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM. She then plans to resume streaming or gaming from 11:00 PM to 12:30 AM. Finally, she aims to wind down and reflect on her day from 12:30 AM to 1:30 AM, planning for the future. She should prioritize getting ready for bed by 1:30 AM to ensure she gets a good night’s sleep by 2:00 AM. 

Although Maria feels a mix of accomplishment and fatigue from balancing her studies and streaming, she appreciates her structured schedule and looks forward to engaging in new topics, like her interest in gentrification, if time permits.
