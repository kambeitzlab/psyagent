As she prepares for the day, she allows herself to feel the mix of emotions that accompany her responsibilities at Hobbs Cafe. The familiar morning rituals offer her a small sense of comfort, as she reminds herself to focus on emotional readiness throughout the day.

By 8:00 AM, Isabella arrives at Hobbs Cafe, ready to open for business. She embraces the familiar ambiance and the loyal patrons who provide her solace. From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, she works at the counter, serving customers with a gentle smile, though her heart feels heavy. In these moments, she finds that connecting with her community helps ease her sorrow, even if it’s just momentarily.

At 12:00 PM, Isabella takes a short break to have a snack and gather her thoughts. The brief respite allows her to center herself for the remaining hours. As she returns to managing the cafe until 3:00 PM, she remains acutely aware of her emotional state, being gentle with herself when waves of grief wash over her.

From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, Isabella dedicates time to assess the aftermath of the Valentine's Day party. This reflection is bittersweet, as it prompts her to gather feedback and think about future events while also grappling with the absence of her mother’s support. She allows herself to feel the emotions that arise, understanding that it is part of her healing journey.

As closing procedures begin around 6:00 PM, Isabella feels a mix of accomplishment and fatigue. Hobbs Cafe officially closes at 8:00 PM, marking the end of a long day. Post-closing, she returns home, needing to unwind after another day of navigating her responsibilities amid grief.

By 8:30 PM, Isabella prepares a comforting dinner, focusing on recreating the warm soup and fresh bread her mother often made. After dinner, she curls up with a favorite book, allowing herself the space to both reflect on her mother’s memory and cherish the love that remains with her.
