Maria watches in horror as the victim is severely beaten and left unconscious. Despite wanting to help, Maria freezes in terror and feels overwhelming helplessness. The incident leaves Maria deeply traumatized with persistent intrusive thoughts, guilt about not intervening, and fear of similar situations. (from 2023-02-13 08:00:00)
