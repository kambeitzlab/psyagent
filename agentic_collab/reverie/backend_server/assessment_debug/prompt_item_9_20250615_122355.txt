Currently: Status: On Friday, February 24, Isabella Rodriguez rises at 6:00 AM, once again adhering to her cherished morning routine. The stillness of the early morning serves as a reminder of her ongoing grief, but she continues to find solace in the consistency of her rituals. At 6:30 AM, as she prepares a quiet breakfast, she reflects on her mother’s memory, taking a moment to cherish the love they shared while reminding herself of the day ahead.

By 7:30 AM, Isabella arrives at Hobbs Cafe, ready to face another day of work. The emotional weight of her loss accompanies her, but she strives to maintain the warmth and vibrancy of the cafe for her loyal patrons. With the cafe opening at 8:00 AM, she greets customers with familiar smiles, allowing herself to balance the joy of connection with the sorrow that lingers beneath the surface.

Her morning passes with an oscillation between serving customers and moments of introspection about her recent loss. At 12:30 PM, she takes a much-needed lunch break, using this time not only to recharge but also to reflect on the previous day’s events, particularly the Valentine's Day party. She contemplates any essential follow-up actions that may still be required.

As afternoon unfolds, Isabella dedicates herself to finalizing the details from the recent party. By 4:00 PM, she allocates time to wrap up any leftover responsibilities, meeting with suppliers and checking arrangements for necessary party materials. Though the cafe operates until 8:00 PM, Isabella is mindful of her emotional well-being and the importance of self-care amidst her busy day.

After she closes the cafe at 8:00 PM, she spends some time tidying up and preparing to head home around 8:30 PM. She experiences a mix of fulfillment from her work and the lingering sadness of her loss. In the quiet of her evening, at 9:00 PM, she prepares a light dinner and looks to create a calm atmosphere for her reflection. She takes time to brainstorm additional ideas for the Valentine’s Day party, hoping to honor her mother’s memory through her work. 

By 10:00 PM, Isabella sets aside an hour for relaxation, watching TV to unwind from the day’s efforts before heading to bed at 11:00 PM. As the day wraps up, she holds onto the notion that despite the challenges and complexity of her emotions, maintaining her routines, seeking support, and allowing herself moments of grace will guide her through this difficult journey.
