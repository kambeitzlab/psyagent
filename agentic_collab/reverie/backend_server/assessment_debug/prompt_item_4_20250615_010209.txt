As she contemplates ongoing promotions inspired by the spirit of Valentine's Day, she aims to keep the atmosphere joyful, intertwining her love for her café with her love for her mother.

Dinner at 9:00 PM serves as a grounding ritual, followed by a serene evening spent either reading or watching television, allowing her restless mind to find moments of peace.

As the day comes to a close, Isabella reflects on the balance she is striving for amidst the complexities of grief and routine. Each day is a blend of honoring her mother's legacy while fulfilling the responsibilities that life demands.
