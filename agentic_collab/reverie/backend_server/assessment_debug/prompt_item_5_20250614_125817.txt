Currently: Status: On Wednesday, February 22, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez awakens at 6:00 am, finding comfort in her quiet morning routine amidst the haze of grief. As she prepares a simple breakfast at 7:00 am, her thoughts drift to her mother, whose absence continues to weigh heavily on her heart. Despite the pain, she steels herself for the day ahead, knowing that the cleanup from yesterday’s Valentine's Day party awaits at Hobbs Cafe.

By 8:00 am, Isabella arrives at the cafe, taking a moment to breathe deeply and absorb the familiar atmosphere. The remnants of the celebration are scattered around her—a reminder of the joy shared with her customers, but also of the loss she now carries. She begins to clean up, sorting through decorations and assessing the inventory while allowing herself brief moments of reflection.

Throughout the morning, Isabella takes intermittent breaks, reminding herself of the importance of self-care as she navigates her emotions. Engaging with customers who arrive to chat about the party, she fosters those connections that bring warmth to her heart. As she tidies up, she also contemplates future themes and events that could enliven the cafe, considering creative ideas that would honor her mother’s vibrant spirit.

Around midday, she acknowledges the need for personal time. Isabella plans to take a walk later in the afternoon to clear her mind and seek solace in nature. She understands that while she is responsible for the cafe and her customers, she must also prioritize her healing process. No specific meetings or events are scheduled for the day, allowing her the flexibility to manage her emotional state and handle the necessary tasks at her pace.

As the hours pass, Isabella embraces the delicate balance of maintaining her cafe while allowing herself the space to grieve. She resolves to take it one step at a time, holding onto the cherished memories of her mother as a guiding light through this turbulent time.
