Currently: Status: On Tuesday, February 21, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 am, but the usual excitement for the day feels muted under the heavy weight of grief from her mother's recent passing. She completes her morning rituals, albeit with a deep sense of sorrow that lingers as she prepares a simple breakfast at 6:30 am. Arriving at Hobbs Cafe by 7:30 am, she feels the familiar hustle and bustle of the cafe but struggles to find her usual energy and joy.

At 8:00 am, as she unlocks the doors and starts to serve coffee and pastries, Isabella engages with her regular customers, but her heart isn’t fully in it. The warmth of the cafe is present, but it serves as a bittersweet reminder of the joy she feels she has lost. Throughout the morning, she finds herself reflecting on her mother's love and the way she celebrated life, which only deepens her sadness.

During her lunch break at 12:30 pm, Isabella sits alone, needing a moment to gather her thoughts. She considers how best to manage her responsibilities at the cafe while also accounting for her emotional state. Although she had planned to work until 4:00 pm, Isabella contemplates whether she should leave early or ask for help from her staff, especially if her feelings become overwhelming.

Isabella decides to reach out to her friend Maria Lopez, whose support has been invaluable. She knows that connecting with Maria could bring her some comfort, and they agree to meet after her shift, allowing for a moment of companionship and understanding amidst her grief.

Throughout the day, Isabella acknowledges the preparations for the upcoming Valentine's Day party, feeling both a sense of obligation and sadness. She understands that she may need to delegate tasks to her staff or request assistance to ensure everything runs smoothly, prioritizing her need for self-care and emotional recovery.

As the day progresses, Isabella sets aside time for self-care after work, planning to indulge in activities that bring her peace, whether it be reading a book, watching a movie, or simply reflecting in quiet solitude. While the usual rhythm of her day feels interrupted, Isabella recognizes the significance of taking time to heal as she navigates the complicated emotions of loss. Ultimately, she embraces the understanding that it's okay to adjust her plans to prioritize her well-being while holding on to the cherished memories of her mother.
