Currently: Status: On Wednesday, February 22, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 AM, just as she did the day before. This morning, however, carries an additional layer of stillness as she reflects on her mother's passing two days prior. After completing her morning rituals, she sits down for breakfast at 6:30 AM, allowing herself a moment of gratitude for the little things, while quietly honoring her mother's memory.

By 7:30 AM, Isabella arrives at Hobbs Cafe, feeling the familiar weight of responsibility, but also the pressing need to take a step back and check in with her emotional state. As she prepares the cafe for the day ahead, she is mindful of her grief, striving to create the warm atmosphere her customers appreciate while giving herself permission to feel the depth of her sorrow.

The cafe opens at 8:00 AM. While she greets her regular patrons with her trademark smile, internally, Isabella grapples with moments of distraction, triggered by memories of her mother intertwined with her daily tasks. As morning rolls into noon, Isabella takes a much-needed lunch break at 12:30 PM, using this time to reflect and recharge, acknowledging the importance of self-care as she navigates her emotional landscape.

Returning to the cafe, her focus is split between her responsibilities and the reminders of her mother's absence. Though itâ€™s a busy day with tasks and operations to manage until the cafe closes at 4:00 PM, Isabella notes the bittersweet nature of her work as she prepares for the upcoming Valentine's Day party, which still looms in her mind as a celebration she wants to honor.

Once the final customers have been served and the cafe has closed for the day, Isabella spends time tidying up and organizing thoughts around the party's follow-ups, including thank-you notes and collecting any feedback. She departs Hobbs Cafe around 5:00 PM, feeling a mix of accomplishment and lingering sadness.

As the evening unfolds, Isabella prepares a comforting dinner at around 6:30 PM, once again allowing herself the space to mourn. In the quiet of her apartment, she reflects on fond memories shared with her mother, recognizing that while grief is a profound challenge, allowing herself these moments is integral to the healing process.

Before drifting off to sleep, Isabella resolves to remain flexible in her approach to balancing her grief and responsibilities. She aims to embrace the support of her cafe community and cherish the memories of her mother, hoping that each small step forward will lead her toward finding light amid the darkness.
