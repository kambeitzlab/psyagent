As the early morning light filters through her apartment, she prepares her breakfast at 6:30 AM, taking a moment to reflect on her mother's memory while also reminding herself to look forward to the day ahead.

At Hobbs Cafe, Isabella arrives by 7:30 AM, aware that the remnants of the Valentine's Day party from the previous day require her attention. While she sets up the cafe, she remains mindful of her emotional state, balancing her commitment to her work with the heartache of her recent loss. The cafe opens at 8:00 AM, and as she greets her loyal patrons with warmth, the underlying sadness she carries tends to surface, yet she aims to channel that feeling into creating a welcoming atmosphere for all.

Throughout the morning, Isabella finds herself oscillating between routine tasks and moments of contemplation about the party's outcomes.

Her responsibilities will last until 4:00 PM when the cafe closes for the day, but she remains committed to focusing on both her work and her emotional needs.

Once the hustle of the day comes to a close, she tidies up around the cafe and begins to draft thank-you notes for attendees of the party, finding solace in the meaningful connections she fosters through her work. Departing from Hobbs Cafe around 5:00 PM, she experiences a blend of fulfillment and lingering sorrow.

In the evening, Isabella prepares a comforting dinner at around 6:30 PM, allowing herself space for reflection and mourning. As she sits quietly, she cherishes the memories of her mother, integrating her loss into her daily life while remaining open to the healing process ahead.
