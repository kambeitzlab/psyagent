Currently: Status: On Saturday, February 18, Maria Lopez wakes up at 9:00 AM, determined to maintain the comforting structure of her routine while also prioritizing her emotional well-being. She feels the weight of the traumatic event from earlier in the week still lingering, but she's resolved to allow herself time for recovery and self-care throughout the day.

At 10:00 AM, Maria enjoys a nutritious breakfast and takes a moment to check her social media briefly. She consciously limits her online activity, recognizing the need for balance in her day. Reflecting on her priorities, she acknowledges the importance of implementing light activities and relaxation techniques to help cope with the intrusive thoughts and emotional weight she carries.

By 11:00 AM, Maria heads to Hobbs Cafe to continue studying physics, a routine she has established for the week. She intends to focus on her studies from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, recognizing the importance of staying on track with her academic commitments while also allowing space for her emotional journey. At 1:00 PM, she takes a well-deserved lunch break, allowing herself time to recharge.

After lunch, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, Maria returns to her studies, pushing through the underlying anxiety as she immerses herself in her coursework. Once her study session concludes, she returns home, reflecting on how she might want to approach her evening. Recognizing the intensity of the past week, she considers having a lighter, casual gaming session with friends rather than a scheduled Twitch stream, prioritizing her mental health.

At 6:00 PM, Maria prepares dinner, taking the opportunity to enjoy the simple act of cooking and nourishing herself. By 7:00 PM, if she's feeling comfortable, she may engage with friends or followers in a more casual setting, finding strength in their connection without the pressure of a full streaming schedule.

As the evening winds down around 9:00 PM, Maria plans to focus on self-care, allowing herself time to relax and unwind. By 11:00 PM, she will begin her bedtime routine, aiming to immerse herself in a book or light gaming until she drifts off to sleep by 2:00 AM.

All day long, Maria is acutely aware of her emotional state and the necessity of listening to herself as she navigates her feelings. She finds solace in her established routine but acknowledges the emotional turbulence she experiences as she continues her journey toward healing and self-love.
