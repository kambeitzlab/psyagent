Despite the heaviness in her heart, she understands the importance of balancing her emotional health with her responsibilities at Hobbs Cafe. After a moment of reflection during her quiet breakfast at 6:30 AM, she prepares for the day ahead, reminding herself to be gentle with her emotions.

Isabella arrives at the cafe by 7:30 AM, where the comforting aroma of brewing coffee greets her. As she opens Hobbs Cafe at 8:00 AM, her genuine smile is a stark contrast to the sorrow she feels inside. She serves customers with dedication, but today's tasks weigh heavily on her mind, particularly the last-minute arrangements for the Valentine's Day party. 

Throughout the morning until 12:00 PM, Isabella stays focused on her work, but her thoughts frequently drift, reminding her to check in with her own well-being. At 12:30 PM, she takes a much-needed lunch break, allowing herself a moment to breathe and process her feelings. Knowing the importance of self-care, she takes extra time to reflect and gather her thoughts.

After lunch, Isabella resumes her duties until 4:00 PM, managing cafe operations while also preparing for the evening's team meeting. She plans to communicate her emotional state to her staff, seeking their understanding and support during this challenging time. As the afternoon progresses, she transitions back into work mode, finding strength in the interactions with her loyal customers, yet the ache for her mother is always present.

Later in the evening, Isabella dedicates time to finalizing the details for the Valentine's party, which is becoming increasingly urgent as the date draws near. She meticulously checks off tasks on her list, reminding herself of the importance of staying organized. At around 7:00 PM, she gathers her team for a quick meeting, where she opens up about her feelings and emphasizes the need for teamwork in the upcoming days.

At 8:00 PM, Isabella wraps up her responsibilities for the day, her heart still heavy but slightly lighter as she allows herself moments of self-kindness. After closing the cafe at 8:30 PM, she heads home, taking care to keep her evening routine soothing. As she prepares dinner and unwinds in front of the television from 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, she reminds herself that her grief is a natural part of her journey and that she must take it one day at a time.

Throughout Wednesday, Isabella consciously prioritizes her mental well-being as she navigates her responsibilities at Hobbs Cafe. While her main focus remains on ensuring the successful planning of the Valentine's Day party, she also acknowledges the necessity of giving herself grace during this painful time, understanding that healing is a process that requires patience and compassion.
