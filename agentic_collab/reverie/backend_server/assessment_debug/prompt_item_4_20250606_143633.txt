Currently: Status: On Wednesday, February 22, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 AM, still feeling the weight of her mother's passing but determined to navigate through her day with grace. After brewing her morning coffee at 7:00 AM, she takes a moment to breathe deeply, allowing the familiar aroma to offer her a small sense of comfort. With the café opening at 8:00 AM, Isabella steels herself for what lies ahead, mindful that today will be another step in her emotional journey.

Throughout the morning, as customers stream into Hobbs Cafe, Isabella greets them with her signature smile, though she consciously allows herself to lean into her feelings when the sadness bubbles to the surface. She balances her responsibilities from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, serving coffee and food while also taking brief emotional check-ins to ensure she remains grounded amidst the busyness.

Recognizing her need for self-care, Isabella has scheduled a longer break mid-morning. During this time, she finds solace in reading a few pages from her favorite book, using this as a gentle reminder to give herself grace and space. She may also reach out to friends, seeking connections that can help lift her spirits.

In the afternoon, Isabella plans to assess the leftover inventory from the Valentine's Day event, focusing on the clean-up and restocking processes. This task not only helps manage the café's operations but also serves as a welcome distraction, allowing her to channel her emotional energy into something productive. 

As the café quiets down, she takes a moment to reflect on the support she has received from her community, and considers how to enhance the café's atmosphere further to honor her mother’s memory. Her day culminates in a relaxing evening planned for unwinding with some TV time and reviewing her physics notes, which she has been meaning to tackle in quieter moments. She aims to prepare for bed by 10:30 PM, with the hope of finding rest by 11:00 PM.

Throughout this day, Isabella embraces the full spectrum of her emotions, allowing herself to grieve while simultaneously cherishing the joyful moments that come from both her work at Hobbs Cafe and the legacy of her mother’s spirit. Each step she takes is a testament to her resilience as she continues her journey through grief and healing.
