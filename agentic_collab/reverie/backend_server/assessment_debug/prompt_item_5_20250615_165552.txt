At 6:30 AM, she prepares a nourishing breakfast, taking a few moments to relish the comfort of familiar rituals while recalling her mother’s love for cooking. Each bite serves as a reminder to prioritize her emotional well-being, even as the sadness envelops her.

By 7:30 AM, Isabella arrives at Hobbs Café, preparing the space for the day ahead. The scent of freshly brewed coffee offers a momentary reprieve, and she greets each familiar face with a warm smile, though the weight of her grief is ever-present. She engages with customers, serving coffee and pastries until noon, finding solace in the community that surrounds her, each interaction a bittersweet dance between her lingering sorrow and brief moments of joy.

Around 12:30 PM, Isabella takes a much-needed lunch break, using this time to breathe and reflect on the delicate balance of her responsibilities and the heartache she carries. The afternoon passes with steady work as she continues to manage the café until 4:00 PM, striving for small victories in her interactions while still feeling the heaviness of her loss.

The memories of laughter-filled plans with friends, particularly with Maria, are tinged with a bittersweet nostalgia that leaves her feeling lost.
