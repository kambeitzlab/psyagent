By 8:00 AM, he is on his way to the library at Oak Hill College, ready to dive into research and gather more resources from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM, where he hopes to gain further insights to enhance his paper.

At noon, he takes a well-deserved break at Hobbs Cafe, allowing himself to step away from the academic pressure. This moment is crucial for recharging before he returns to writing from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM, when he will focus on developing his arguments and refining his research paper.

From 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM, he plans to focus on editing his paper, aiming to refine his writing and regain his confidence.

As the night approaches, Klaus sets aside time from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM for himself, choosing to read or listen to music to unwind after a productive day. By 11:00 PM, he prepares for bed, hopeful that he is making strides on his journey of rebuilding confidence and redefining his understanding of success.
