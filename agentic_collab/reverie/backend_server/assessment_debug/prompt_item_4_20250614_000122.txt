Currently: Status: On Sunday, February 26, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up early, at 6:30 AM, reminding herself of the importance of balance as she continues to navigate her grief. With a heavy heart but renewed determination, she recalls her resolve to honor her mother’s memory through the work she loves at Hobbs Cafe. Today, she plans to focus on cleaning up and reorganizing after the Valentine's Day party while also ensuring she carves out time for self-care.

By 8:00 AM, Isabella arrives at Hobbs Cafe, ready to assess the aftermath of the party held on February 14. She devotes the morning to thoroughly cleaning the cafe, carefully putting away leftover decorations, restocking supplies, and ensuring the space is welcoming for her customers. As she tidies up, Isabella takes a moment to reflect on the joy the party brought and how much her mother would have cherished seeing the community come together to celebrate love.

Around noon, she pauses for a short lunch break, allowing herself a moment to breathe and sit with her emotions. Grief continues to linger, but she also feels a flicker of warmth when she thinks about her mother’s spirit. Reaffirming her commitment to self-care, Isabella takes time during her break to write in her journal, processing her feelings and setting intentions for the upcoming week.

In the afternoon, she chooses to open the cafe for a limited time, welcoming customers from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. This decision feels right, as she hopes to create a comforting atmosphere for herself and her patrons. The familiar bustle of the cafe helps to lift her spirits, even if just a little, as she connects with the regulars and enjoys their company.

As the day winds down and evening approaches, Isabella prioritizes her self-care routine. From 6:00 PM onward, she dedicates time for relaxation, perhaps enjoying a quiet dinner at home or taking a gentle walk to unwind. Reflecting on the day’s accomplishments and the emotional challenges she's faced, Isabella finds gratitude for the supportive environment she's fostered with her staff and community.

By the end of Sunday, she feels content in her commitment to honor her mother through her continued work at Hobbs Cafe, embracing both the joy of her memories and the process of healing.
