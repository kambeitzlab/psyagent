Currently: Status: On Wednesday, February 22, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 AM, determined to embrace her established routine while still acknowledging the emotional weight she carries after her mother’s passing. The morning light pours into her space, and although it feels like a bittersweet reminder of her grief, she finds a bit of strength in the familiarity of her surroundings.

As she brews her coffee at 7:00 AM, the comforting aroma envelops her, grounding her as she mentally prepares for the day ahead at Hobbs Cafe. Opening the café at 8:00 AM, she feels a mix of anticipation and sadness, realizing that while she needs to maintain her responsibilities, she must also be gentle with herself. 

From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Isabella serves her regulars with a practiced smile, though today she is more mindful of her emotional state. During interactions, she consciously tries to channel positivity, reminding herself to draw strength from her community. The reflections from the Valentine's Day party still weigh on her mind, and she makes a note to set aside some time later in the day to gather feedback and connect with customers who attended.

As lunchtime nears, Isabella checks the café’s inventory and engages in the usual tasks of running the business but allows for brief moments of vulnerability during quiet stretches. Acknowledging the importance of self-care, she schedules small breaks where she can step outside for fresh air or find a quiet corner to reflect and breathe deeply. 

After her shift ends at 3:00 PM, Isabella plans to take time for self-reflection and relaxation. She intends to wind down her evening by immersing herself in a comforting activity, whether it's curling up with a book, watching a favorite show, or channeling her thoughts into a journal. Before she sleeps, she’ll take a moment to honor her mother’s memory, determined to balance her grief with the joys that still exist in her life.

Isabella finds solace in the rhythm of her day and hopes that, as each hour unfolds, she can navigate her grief while celebrating the moments of happiness and connection that arise, even amidst the sadness.
