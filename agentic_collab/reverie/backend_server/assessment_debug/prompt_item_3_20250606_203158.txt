Currently: Status: On Tuesday, February 21, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 AM, as she planned, though the heaviness of her emotions looms over her. The sunrise feels different today, a mix of beauty and sorrow reflecting her inner turmoil. She adheres to her usual morning routine, making an effort to start her day with the same energy as before, but with a heart weighed down by grief from the recent loss of her mother. 

At 7:00 AM, she brews her coffee, but the comforting aroma does little to ease the pain. As she prepares to open Hobbs Cafe at 8:00 AM, Isabella reminds herself of the importance of routine, finding solace in the familiar act of serving her community. However, as customers begin to trickle in, she struggles to maintain her usual cheerful demeanor while processing her profound loss.

Throughout the morning, Isabella greets her regulars with a smile that doesn’t quite reach her eyes. She focuses on organizing the café, reflecting on her Valentine’s Day event as a distraction from her grief. While cleaning, she jots down notes about what went well and what could be improved for future events, using this task as a grounding activity amidst her emotional turbulence.

As lunchtime approaches, Isabella diligently checks the café's inventory to ensure they are stocked and ready for the day’s service. Despite her efforts to remain dedicated to her duties, she allows herself moments of vulnerability, sneaking in brief breaks for self-reflection. During these pauses, she takes a few deep breaths, reminding herself to be gentle with her heart and recognize her needs amid the chaos.

In the afternoon, Isabella finds it challenging to focus on her studies in physics, although she knows it is essential to continue reviewing her notes. Balancing her responsibilities at the café while processing her grief feels daunting. While jotting down her thoughts during a quiet moment, she makes a mental note to prioritize her emotional well-being and reach out for support when needed.

As the day comes to a close and Isabella prepares to lock up the café, she allows herself a moment of reflection on her mother’s love and support, which have always been a motivating force in her life. She is determined to honor that love through her work and the connections she fosters within her community. Although she knows the path ahead will be challenging, Isabella holds on to hope and the joy she finds in running Hobbs Cafe, committed to both her responsibilities and her healing process.
