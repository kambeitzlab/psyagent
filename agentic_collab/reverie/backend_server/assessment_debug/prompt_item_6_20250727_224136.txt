Currently: Status: On Sunday, February 26, Maria Lopez wakes up at 9:00 AM, ready to start another day while adhering to the structured routine that helps ground her. After completing her morning routine, which includes self-care and preparing her mind for the day ahead, she enjoys breakfast at 9:30 AM. During this time, she checks her social media to stay connected with friends and gather support, a practice that continues to uplift her spirits as she navigates her recent trauma.

From 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, Maria dedicates her time to studying physics at Hobbs Cafe. The familiar environment provides her the focus she needs to tackle academic responsibilities while allowing for a moment of solace amidst her emotional struggles. The caf√© has become a comforting backdrop for her efforts to engage with her studies deeply.

At 1:00 PM, Maria takes a break to have lunch at Hobbs Cafe, savoring the food and the comforting space as she reflects on her work and the emotions swirling within her. She acknowledges the ongoing impact of the traumatic incident she witnessed but strives to maintain a sense of normalcy throughout her day.

Anticipating her Twitch streaming session from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, Maria views this time as an essential outlet for self-expression and connection. Engaging with her audience brings her joy and allows her to channel her feelings positively, creating an inviting atmosphere on her stream.

After taking a dinner break at 6:00 PM, Maria plans to continue her gaming or streaming activities from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM. This evening time is important for her to unwind and enjoy her favorite hobbies while balancing productivity with emotional self-care.

From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, she takes the time to wind down and reflect on her day, perhaps journaling her thoughts or practicing mindfulness exercises to help process her feelings and navigate the complexities of her emotions.

Afterward, from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM, Maria looks forward to connecting with friends online. Whether playing casual games or sharing conversations, she cherishes these moments, knowing they provide a sense of companionship and alleviate some of the weight she carries.

As she prepares for bed around 2:00 AM, Maria is conscientious about her sleep schedule and the importance of rest for her overall well-being. With therapy sessions approaching later in the week with Dr. Sarah Thompson, she remains committed to balancing self-care with her everyday responsibilities. Maria embraces each moment and activity as part of her ongoing journey toward healing and reclaiming her sense of safety and joy, taking life one day at a time.
