Currently: Status: On Saturday, March 4, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up at 6:00 AM, honoring her morning routine while remaining mindful of her emotional well-being. After a nourishing and peaceful breakfast at 6:30 AM, she heads to Hobbs Café by 7:30 AM to prepare for the day ahead. As the café opens at 8:00 AM, Isabella takes a moment to breathe deeply, savoring the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the familiar ambiance that brings her both comfort and a poignant reminder of her mother's absence.

From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Isabella engages with customers, serving coffee and pastries, and cherishing the small moments of connection amidst her grief. She allows herself to smile and practice gratitude for the community that surrounds her, though a twinge of sadness accompanies her every interaction. At 12:30 PM, she takes a short lunch break, using this time for quiet reflection. Sitting in a cozy corner of the café, she allows herself to indulge in a little nostalgia, remembering her mother and the warmth of their shared meals.

As the day progresses, she continues her evening service until 8:00 PM. After closing the café, Isabella takes an hour to clean up and prepare for the party, feeling a moment of accomplishment in her productivity. At about 9:00 PM, she heads home, where a light dinner awaits her. Later, in the comfort of her favorite reading nook, she indulges in literature, losing herself in stories that allow her to escape for a while.

As Isabella reflects on the day, she reminds herself of the importance of self-care and the need to embrace the support of her friends. She recognizes that healing is a journey filled with ups and downs, and that it is okay to take things one step at a time.
