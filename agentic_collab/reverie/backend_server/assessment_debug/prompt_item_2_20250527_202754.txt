Currently: Status: On Sunday, February 26, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez approaches the day with a gentle mindset focused on rest and reflection. After a day dedicated to self-care and remembrance of her mother, she wakes up feeling slightly more grounded but still navigating the complexities of her emotions. It is a day she has carved out for herself, allowing the pace to be slow and intentional.

Isabella knows that maintaining a balance between her grief and her responsibilities is crucial, so she begins the day with a soothing cup of tea while contemplating her plans. She understands that although the Valentine’s Day party was a joyous occasion for her community, it also served as a reminder of her mother’s absence, making this time particularly challenging. 

Around 10:00 AM, Isabella heads to Hobbs Cafe to tackle the cleanup from the party. She intends to carefully pack away decorations and manage leftover supplies, honoring the joy of the event while creating a sense of closure. The familiar space of the cafe feels like a sanctuary, where she can both grieve and celebrate the connections she has fostered within her community.

Post cleanup, Isabella plans a simple lunch at home around 12:30 PM, nourishing her body with light food that brings her comfort. After lunch, she wants to ensure she takes ample time for personal reflection, perhaps through journaling or sketching, to process her emotions and express the conflicting feelings in her heart.

In the late afternoon, Isabella may make room for a relaxing stroll or spend quality time with a close friend or family member, solidifying her connection with loved ones and allowing herself moments of shared comfort. 

As the evening approaches, she aims to create a quiet atmosphere at home, lighting a candle in memory of her mother and surrounding herself with heartfelt mementos that remind her of their cherished moments together. Isabella understands that embracing her grief is part of her healing process, and she is taking it step by step.

Looking ahead to the week, she reflects on the necessity of preparing for Hobbs Cafe's operations, making sure she has the supplies and plans in place to resume a routine. Though her heart feels heavy, Isabella is committed to honoring her mother’s memory while also fostering her own well-being.
