She has scheduled a quick dinner at 6:00 PM, making sure to sustain her energy for the stream.

Once her gaming session concludes at 7:00 PM, Maria takes some time to relax and socialize with friends until 9:00 PM. She is mindful of the recent stress surrounding her research grant application rejection, but she is relying on her routine to provide comfort and a sense of normalcy. At 9:00 PM, she begins a second Twitch stream that will last until 12:00 AM, enjoying the interaction with her audience and the creative outlet it provides.

After her stream, Maria allows herself time to unwind from 12:00 AM to 2:00 AM, whether through casual gaming or catching up on her favorite shows. As she prepares for bed around 2:00 AM, she reflects on her day. Despite the challenges she faces, including the emotional toll of the grant rejection, Maria remains determined to push forward, embracing her passions and striving for balance in her academic and personal life.
