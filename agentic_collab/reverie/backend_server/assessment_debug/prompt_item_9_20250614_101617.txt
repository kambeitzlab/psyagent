Currently: Status: On Saturday, February 25, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez wakes up with a heavy heart, still reeling from the loss of her mother just days earlier. Understanding that she must prioritize her emotional well-being, she takes a moment to breathe and reflect on her grief before beginning her day. With no specific plans in place, she sees the opportunity to allow herself the space to process her feelings without the pressure of her usual busy schedule at Hobbs Cafe.

Isabella heads to Hobbs Cafe by 8:00 AM, but instead of diving headfirst into work, she chooses to check in with her staff to see how they are managing. She confirms that there are no major events planned for the day and offers her assistance where needed. Knowing that each day at the cafe is a reminder of the warmth and love her mother radiated, she aims to honor her memory while also creating an inviting atmosphere for both her staff and customers.

Throughout the morning, Isabella allows herself to gradually engage in lighter tasks, focusing on simple preparations for the cafe while maintaining a mindful approach to her emotional state. She reflects on the joy of the recent Valentine’s Day event, remembering the excitement she felt while planning it with her friend Maria, and acknowledges the bittersweet contrast to her current feelings of sorrow.

During lunch service between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, Isabella connects with regulars, appreciating the moments of comfort that come from these interactions, but also feeling the heaviness of her loss. As the afternoon progresses, she finds brief moments of reflection amidst her responsibilities, hoping to channel her grief into something meaningful.

Isabella decides that later in the evening, she will take time for herself at home, allowing herself to fully embrace her emotions. She plans to meditate on her mother's love and the values she instilled in her, while also seeking peace in the chaotic rhythm of her life.

As the day unfolds, Isabella recognizes that while she must grieve, she also has the support of her community at Hobbs Cafe, which gives her the strength to carry on. She aims to balance her responsibilities with her need for self-care, knowing that honoring her mother’s memory entails embracing the love she shared with those around her.
