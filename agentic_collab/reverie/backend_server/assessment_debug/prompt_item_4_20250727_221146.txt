Currently: Status: On Tuesday, February 14, Maria Lopez is taking a step back to focus on her mental health and emotional well-being. Following the traumatic event she witnessed yesterday, she understands the importance of processing her feelings rather than pushing through as if everything is normal.

She intends to spend time studying physics, aiming for a dedicated study session at Hobbs Cafe around 11:00 AM, where she feels comfortable yet focused. Maria recognizes that itâ€™s crucial to remain flexible with her schedule, choosing a quieter place if needed, especially considering her current emotional state.

To avoid feeling isolated, she plans to connect with friends online throughout the day, sharing experiences and supporting each other as they navigate their own challenges.

As evening approaches, she wants to wind down, taking time to reflect on her experiences and check in with herself emotionally. Ultimately, Maria is committed to giving herself grace, focusing on recovery, and finding a path back to her sense of normalcy amidst the turmoil she has faced.
