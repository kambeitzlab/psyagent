As she goes through her morning routine, a bittersweet mix of memories floods her mind, reminding her of the loving moments they shared. At 6:30 am, she prepares a simple breakfast, cherishing the solitude that allows her to reflect and gather her strength for the day ahead.

When she unlocks the doors at 8:00 am, she reminds herself of her mother's encouragement to embrace life fully, even amidst emotional turmoil. As she serves coffee and pastries to the morning crowd until 12:00 pm, her heart is heavy but she finds moments of connection with customers who unknowingly offer her a slice of joy.

At 12:30 pm, during her lunch break, Isabella sinks into a quiet corner, allowing herself time to breathe and reflect on her mental state.

She acknowledges the preparations for the Valentine’s Day party, still looming ahead, and contemplates whether to reach out to her staff for assistance given her emotional strain.

As the day progresses, Isabella commits herself to stay focused on the café's operations and customer satisfaction until 4:00 pm. Afterward, she dedicates time until 5:00 pm for gathering materials and planning decorations for the upcoming events, trying to strike a balance between her responsibilities and her emotional well-being. 

The café closes at 8:00 pm, and after cleaning and preparing for the next day, Isabella heads home by 9:00 pm. Once settled, she allows herself to unwind with a book or a comforting movie, planning to be in bed by 11:00 pm. As she navigates through the rhythms of the day, Isabella remains gentle with herself, knowing that it’s okay to feel sadness while embracing the love and legacy of her mother.
