She considers calling friends or family, needing their support or simply a comforting voice to help her navigate her grief. 

Isabella is keenly aware that while her heart feels heavy, the memories of her mother continue to inspire her. She hopes to honor that spirit as she carries on, asking herself how she can infuse that love into her work at the café.
