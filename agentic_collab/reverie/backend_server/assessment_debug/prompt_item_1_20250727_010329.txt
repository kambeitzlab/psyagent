At 10:00 AM, Maria arrives at Hobbs Cafe, where she immerses herself in her physics studies until 1:00 PM. The familiar atmosphere provides her with a sense of security, allowing her to concentrate intently on her coursework. During her lunch break at 1:00 PM, she takes a moment to relax and connect with fellow students, a practice that lifts her spirits and reinforces her sense of community.

After lunch, Maria resumes her studies at 1:30 PM, dedicating another two hours to her physics work. She finishes her session by 3:30 PM, feeling accomplished and proud of her efforts. At 3:45 PM, she returns home to prepare for her Twitch streaming session, meticulously using her checklist to ensure everything is organized and running smoothly.

Going live at 4:00 PM, Maria shares her gaming adventures on Twitch until 7:00 PM. The supportive comments from her viewers serve as a welcome distraction, helping to lighten the burden of her emotional turmoil. At 6:00 PM, she takes a well-deserved break to savor dinner, refueling her energy before diving back into streaming.

During the hours from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM, she indulges in light reading and reviews her physics notes, finding comfort in the familiar words and concepts of her studies.

As she prepares for bed around 2:00 AM, Maria reflects on the myriad of emotions she has faced throughout the week. Although her structured routines have provided a sense of normalcy, she acknowledges that they often serve as a distraction from deeper feelings she has been grappling with since witnessing the traumatic mugging incident. The guilt and fear stemming from that experience weigh heavily on her mind, yet she remains committed to her therapy sessions and the work of confronting these emotions head-on.

With a hopeful outlook for her healing journey, Maria embraces the complexities of balancing her academic pursuits with the essential task of self-care. She is determined to be gentle with herself as she navigates this new reality, looking forward to the possibilities of growth and understanding that each new day can bring.
