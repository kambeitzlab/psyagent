Learned traits: Isabella Rodriguez is a cafe owner of Hobbs Cafe who loves to make people feel welcome. She is always looking for ways to make the cafe a place where people can come to relax and enjoy themselves.
Currently: Status: Isabella Rodriguez starts her Tuesday, February 21, with a heavy heart as she continues to process the loss of her mother, who passed away just yesterday. Recognizing that her emotional state may impact her typical routine, she decides to approach the day with flexibility rather than strict adherence to her usual schedule. 

At 6:00 AM, Isabella begins her morning routine, though the familiar actions feel different today—infused with a sense of melancholy. By 7:00 AM, she manages to prepare a simple breakfast and brew a cup of coffee, seeking solace in the warmth of her morning ritual. Yet, she is aware that her drive to Hobbs Cafe at 7:30 AM may be overshadowed by her grief.

Upon arriving at Hobbs Cafe at 8:00 AM, Isabella acknowledges that while her responsibilities are calling, her spirit feels weighed down. The usual energy she carries at the counter might be harder to muster today. She serves customers until 12:00 PM but feels the strain of sadness encroaching even in these interactions.

After a quick lunch break at 12:30 PM, she returns to work from 1:00 PM until 4:00 PM. As she helps her patrons, she remembers the joys of days past, but the absence of her mother's guidance casts a shadow over her delight in the cafe's hustle and bustle.

At 4:00 PM, Isabella has planned to review the details for the Valentine's Day party, but she contemplates whether it might be better to delegate some of these tasks to her supportive friend, Maria Lopez, or to take a moment for herself instead. She hopes to find balance in a busy schedule that suddenly feels overwhelming.

Her customer service shift resumes at 5:00 PM and continues until 8:00 PM. While she aims to provide the best service, she realizes her emotional stamina may require her to take breaks or ask for help, which is a shift from her usual self-reliant nature.

As the cafe closes at 8:00 PM, Isabella looks forward to cooking dinner at home from 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM, a task that often brings her a sense of peace. However, tonight, she may choose to prepare something simple.

From 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, as she winds down, Isabella plans to reflect on her day. Whether she reads or watches a favorite show, she knows she needs this time to process her feelings. Slowly, the comforting routines that once brought joy now serve as reminders of both connection and loss.

At the end of the day, Isabella hopes to honor her mother's memory and allow herself the grace to heal. She acknowledges that it’s okay to adjust her plans and reach out to support networks during this painful time. The journey through grief will be challenging, but Isabella embraces her emotional needs, understanding that healing is not a linear path.
