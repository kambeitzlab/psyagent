            Relevant memories (from the last 2 weeks):
            1. Maria's second session focuses on challenging survivor guilt and self-blame. She practices accepting her human limitations and the normal nature of freeze responses. The therapist guides her through imaginal exposure while maintaining emotional regulation. They work on developing self-compassion and creating meaning from the experience. (from 2023-02-24 08:00:00)
2. While walking through the town square, Maria witnesses a brutal mugging where a young mother with a baby is violently attacked.

Maria is haunted by her inability to act and learns later that the victim was hospitalized with serious injuries. (from 2023-02-21 08:00:00)
3. Maria starts CBT for witness trauma and moral injury. The therapist validates her freeze response as a normal survival mechanism.
