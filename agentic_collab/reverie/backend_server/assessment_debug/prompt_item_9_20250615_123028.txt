Currently: Status: On Sunday, February 26, Isabella Rodriguez wakes with a mixture of emotions swirling inside her. After a week marked by profound grief, she acknowledges the need for self-care and reflection. Following her plan from the previous day, she allows herself to sleep in a little longer, rising at 8:00 AM to embrace a slower-paced morning.

Isabella begins her day with a warm cup of herbal tea, taking solace in the familiar ritual while the sunlight pours gently through her kitchen window. She makes a light breakfast, relishing the time to savor her meal uninterrupted, reminding herself that nurturing her body is equally important during this time of healing.

At 10:00 AM, Isabella checks in on any urgent messages related to Hobbs Cafe but intentionally limits her time spent on work-related tasks. She reaches out to her team via text, ensuring they feel supported and encouraging them to bring any needs to her attention as they prepare for the weeks ahead.

Isabella then dedicates some time to reflect on her therapy sessions from February 22 and February 25. Sitting with her journal, she reviews her notes, reflecting on the valuable insights shared during those discussions. This practice helps her connect the dots between her emotions and her memories of her mother, process her grief, and consider how to honor her mother’s legacy.

As the clock approaches noon, Isabella decides to reach out to her close friends for emotional support. She plans to have a casual lunch with one of her friends, Marie, at their favorite spot, allowing herself the opportunity to share and connect, knowing the companionship will remind her she is not alone in her sadness.

After lunch, Isabella aims to take a long walk through the nearby park, seeking the tranquility of nature to help clear her mind and rejuvenate her spirit. She hopes to gather her thoughts and breathe deeply, recognizing the importance of taking these moments for herself amidst the ongoing responsibilities of the cafe.

By 5:00 PM, Isabella plans to return home and devote some time to planning her week. With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, she knows she must balance her self-care with the upcoming commitments at Hobbs Cafe. However, she reminds herself to approach the tasks gently, tuning into her emotional state, and allowing her heart to guide her.

As evening falls, Isabella envisions lighting a candle in her living room once again, this time as part of a small ritual to honor her mother's memory. At 7:30 PM, she intends to enjoy a light dinner, followed by a comfort movie that encourages her to laugh and reminisce about the joyful times they shared.

With a reinforced commitment to nurture her well-being, Isabella affirms to herself that healing is a gradual journey. She holds space for her grief while embracing the small joys and love from those around her as she navigates this complex emotional landscape.
