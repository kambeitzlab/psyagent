As the evening approached, Maria dedicated time for reflection and planning. From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, she reviewed her study progress and set aspirations for the upcoming week, recognizing that she would need to adapt to the recent challenges she faced, particularly concerning her grant application.

Late into the evening, from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM, she allowed herself to relax by playing casual games with friends online. This social time served as a delightful distraction and a way to unwind after a day balanced between productivity and self-care.

Before settling into bed at around 2:00 AM, Maria organized her thoughts and crafted her plans for Monday, feeling a sense of renewed hope.
