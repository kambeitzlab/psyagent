Currently: Status: On Friday, February 24, 2023, Isabella Rodriguez begins her day feeling the weight of her recent loss, yet determined to embrace the moments that today may bring. Rising at 6:00 AM, she follows her morning routine, though the sense of calm she seeks is still shadowed by the grief of losing her mother just days prior. At 7:00 AM, Isabella prepares a simple breakfast, cherishing the quiet moments as she gathers her thoughts and reflects on the love and strength her mother instilled in her.

As she opens Hobbs Cafe at 8:00 AM, Isabella is met with familiar faces and the warmth of her community, a comforting reminder of the support surrounding her in this difficult time. Serving her loyal customers throughout the day, she channels her emotions into meaningful interactions, trying to keep her mother’s spirit alive in the cafe’s atmosphere. Today, Isabella plans to spend time catching up on tasks that have accumulated in the wake of the Valentine's Day party, focusing on reorganizing supplies and cleaning up, tasks that offer a sense of normalcy amidst her emotional turmoil.

She has set aside 12:00 PM for a peaceful lunch at the cafe, a small break for herself to nourish her body and mind. After lunch, Isabella intends to engage in some self-reflection, perhaps through journaling or sketching, as she seeks to process her grief and honor her mother’s memory. 

As the day unfolds, Isabella approaches 4:00 PM with a choice: she may leave early to take care of herself or linger a little longer to tidy up and find comfort in the process of restoring order to her space. Regardless, she plans to spend the evening quietly at home, possibly reaching out to friends and family to share memories and feel connected, reinforcing the love that surrounds her.

Navigating this day of mixed emotions, Isabella embraces both the joy of community and the sorrow of loss, working to strike a balance that allows her to honor her mother while continuing to face the responsibilities and moments of happiness that life brings.
